Darker Chocolate We've discovered the perfect accompaniment to our sweet apricots, cranberries and sultanas, in this intense and fragrant 70% cocoa solids 'darker' chocolate. Its bittersweet flavour is so floral and fruity, you'd think it was picked from the same trees. Brazils Brazil nuts only ever grow wild in the forest - they just can't be cultivated like other nuts. As far as we're concerned, that makes them pretty special. When it comes to their taste, that's pretty special too. We like to use huge pieces, gently roasted for extra crunch. Apricots At Eat Natural, we prefer dried apricots to taste of.. apricots! So, unlike the bright orange ones you may be more familiar with, ours don't contain any preservatives. They're dried naturally in the sun, giving them their rich, dark colour and authentic caramel sweetness. All Eat Natural bars are made with love and care from simple ingredients, in small batches at our own Makery. We never use artificial flavours, colours or preservatives. Here at Eat Natural, when we say 'natural', what exactly do we mean? Well, clearly it would be wrong of us to claim that everything in this bar is '100% natural' and simply 'grows on trees'. Obviously, some ingredients need to be cleaned, dried and roasted too, and therefore, to some extent, 'processed'. It's just that we believe, the less we mess with it.. the better it tastes. That's why we never add any artificial flavours or colours, or any preservatives. Find us on Facebook Twitter@EatNaturalBars  ",

      "description": "The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

Darker Chocolate We've discovered the perfect accompaniment to our sweet apricots, cranberries and sultanas, in this intense and fragrant 70% cocoa solids 'darker' chocolate. Its bittersweet flavour is so floral and fruity, you'd think it was picked from the same trees. Brazils Brazil nuts only ever grow wild in the forest - they just can't be cultivated like other nuts. As far as we're concerned, that makes them pretty special. When it comes to their taste, that's pretty special too. We like to use huge pieces, gently roasted for extra crunch. Apricots At Eat Natural, we prefer dried apricots to taste of.. apricots! So, unlike the bright orange ones you may be more familiar with, ours don't contain any preservatives. They're dried naturally in the sun, giving them their rich, dark colour and authentic caramel sweetness. Cranberries A cranberry is not just for Christmas you know? These beautiful little bouncing balls, bursting with goodness, are perfect all year round. Slightly sweetened to make them less sharp and acidic, these normally festive friends are filled with fruitiness. All Eat Natural bars are made with love and care from simple ingredients, in small batches at our own Makery. We never use artificial flavours, colours or preservatives. Here at Eat Natural, when we say 'natural', what exactly do we mean? Well, clearly it would be wrong of us to claim that everything in this bar is '100% natural' and simply 'grows on trees'. Obviously, some ingredients need to be cleaned, dried and roasted too, and therefore, to some extent, 'processed'. It's just that we believe, the less we mess with it.. the better it tastes. That's why we never add any artificial flavours or colours, or any preservatives. Find us on Facebook Twitter@EatNaturalBars  ",

Entering this new phase of being a mother, I needed a quick snack that provided nourishment and energy for my busy day.  In pursuing a degree in dietetics, I came to understand how food can have a large effect on our body functions and overall health.  With this knowledge I saw the importance of eating healthy for both my son and I.  It was shortly after, that I began experimenting with different recipes that consisted of our macro nutrients, protein, fat and carbohydrates.  In wanting to have all variations of those three nutrients, I started with using 100 % natural ingredients, consisting of oats for the protein, butter for the fat, and sugar, agave, maple syrup, and fruit as my sweeteners and carbohydrates. I wanted something nutritious and yummy.\nI saw oats very differently than most.  To me, it was like working with a cake mix, \"very neutral\".  Meaning, whatever flavor is added to the oats it will take on that flavor.  At that point I began thinking of deserts, candy, popular junk cereal that I knew one day my son would desire and therefore I mimicked those with a healthy twist.  This granola is 100% natural with 100% usable energy. \nWith a variety of different flavors, the yummy line was created for not just adults but for children alike.

Made with a soft, golden baked crust of wheat and whole grain oats and filled with real raspberry puree, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer flavor everyone will love. Not only do Raspberry Nutri-Grain Bars taste great--they are packed nine essential vitamins, eight grams of whole grains, three grams of dietary fiber, and two grams of protein--in each bar. Whether you start your day with a Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar, add it to your child's lunch box as sweet nutritious treat, or enjoy it as a mid-day snack, Raspberry Nutri-Grain Bars offer more of what your body needs to live well and help you eat better all day.  A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.       Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.  About Kellogg Kellogg Company is a leading producer of cereal and convenience foods--a company you can rely on for great-tasting, high quality foods.

Entering this new phase of being a mother, I needed a quick snack that provided nourishment and energy for my busy day.  In pursuing a degree in dietetics, I came to understand how food can have a large effect on our body functions and over all health.  With this knowledge I saw the importance of eating healthy for both my son and I.  It was shortly after, that I began experimenting with different recipes that consisted of our macronutrients, protein, fat and carbohydrates.  In wanting to have all variations of those three nutrients, I started with using 100 % natural ingredients, consisting of oats for the protein, butter for the fat, and sugar, agave, maple syrup, and fruit as my sweeteners and carbohydrates. I wanted something nutritious and yummy.\n\nI saw oats very differently than most.  To me, it was like working with a cake mix, \"very neutral\".  Meaning, whatever flavor is added to the oats it will take on that flavor.  At that point I began thinking of deserts, candy, popular junk cereal that I knew one day my son would desire and therefore I mimicked those with a healthy twist.  This granola is 100% natural with 100% useable energy. \n\nWith a variety of different flavors, the yummy line was created for not just adults but for children alike. Amazingly Rani's Yummy appeals to people who are not generally fond of granola! \n\n\nProduct Description\n\nFresh lime, oats, butter and sugar. Made with real limes, Simple and\ndelicious, just how you like your key lime pie  ",

Made with a soft, golden baked crust of wheat and whole grain oats and filled with real strawberry puree, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer flavor everyone will love. Not only do Strawberry Nutri-Grain Bars taste great--they are packed nine essential vitamins, eight grams of whole grains, three grams of dietary fiber, and two grams of protein--in each bar. Whether you start your day with a Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar, add it to your child's lunch box as sweet nutritious treat, or enjoy it as a mid-day snack, Strawberry Nutri-Grain Bars offer more of what your body needs to live well and help you eat better all day.  A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.       Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.

Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children and adults with needed energy to keep brains and bodies going throughout the day.

Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Special K Snack Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go.

In May 2000, L\u00c4RABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each invidual package by hand-- all 500 of them! Although L\u00c4RABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.

Some people cannot tolerate gluten when it comes in contact with the small intestine. This condition is known as celiac disease. There is also evidence that a skin disorder called dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with gluten intolerance.In patients with celiac disease, gluten injures the lining of the small intestine. This injury results in weight loss, bloating, diarrhea, gas, abdominal cramps, or vitamin and mineral deficiencies. When patients totally eliminate gluten from the diet, the lining of the intestine has a chance to heal. In patients with gluten intolerance or gluten allergy, the symptoms are varied and also respond well to the reduction, severe limiting or removal of gluten from the diet.Removing gluten from the diet is not easy.

      "description": "The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

Be sure, you will not have to lower your expectations even if you are eating a gluten-free, wheat-free snack bar. You do not have to settle for ordinary or tasteless gluten-free bars when Nature\u2019s Path offers so much more--a pinch of this, a dash of that, but never anything artificial. This product contains no artificial additives, preservatives, or colors. Moreover, the USDA organic certification on this product means that the ingredients are grown without synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and nasty chemicals.  It is a sacrifice-free way of enjoying a healthy delicious snack. Whole Grain Goodness for Everyone The specialty of Nature\u2019s Path is, and has always been, everything \u201cwhole grain\u201d. If you decide to go \u201cgluten free\u201d then there is no healthier option than organic gluten free--products that are not only gluten free but also free of other things that can compromise health. Add to that, Non-GMO Project verified for an extra assurance when it comes to food safety. Nature\u2019s Path uses gluten-free grains such as buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum, amaranth, brown rice, flax, teff, and whole grain corn . Amaranth: Long considered a native crop in Peru, amaranth was a major food crop of the ancient Aztecs and played a part in their religious practices as well. Amaranth is gluten free, high in protein, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It is the only grain that also contains vitamin C. Brown Rice: Naturally gluten free, whole-grain rice is usually brown but can also be black, purple, or even red. It is one of the most easily digested grains and though it is lower in fiber, it is still rich in many other nutrients. Buckwheat: It is not technically a grain at all and not any kind of wheat, but rather, a cousin of rhubarb! It is the only grain to have high levels of an antioxidant called rutin and of course, it is gluten free too. Certified gluten free and wheat free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization, an independent service that supervises gluten-free food production according to a consistent, defined, science-based standard that is confirmed by field inspections. Nature\u2019s Path was the first USDA Certified producer of organic breakfast cereal in North America and we're the larges manufacturer of organic cereals to this day. Many of our gluten-free products are Non-GMO Project verified. GMO crops are found in so many of the foods implicated in health and digestive issues and have yet to be proven safe. We keep them out of our foods because we don\u2019t believe in using people as guinea pigs in a lab experiment. Quality Assurance International is a third party certification organization that regularly inspects to ensure stringent organic food standards are met. All Nature\u2019s Path foods are Kosher.  Whole Grain Corn: While it\u2019s true that corn may be familiar, don\u2019t overlook it when it comes to antioxidants. Corn has the highest levels of antioxidants of any grain or vegetable! Quinoa: It is another \u201cgrain\u201d that is not quite a grain. Quinoa is actually a relative of Swiss chard and beets. This gluten free grain was a favorite of the Incas. It comes from South America and is a small, light colored grain that looks a bit like sesame seeds. It is a complete protein, delivering all the essential amino acids our bodies need. Sorghum: This hearty gluten free grain from Africa thrives where other grains would wither and die. It can be eaten like popcorn, cooked into porridge, or made into flour. It is very popular with people who have gluten issues. Teff: This is a tiny grain that comes from Africa--it is 1/150th the size of a wheat kernel. The fact that \u201cteff\u201d comes from the word \u201cteffa\u201d meaning \u201clost\u201d starts to make sense. Teff has a sweet, molasses-like taste and can be used for baked goods, porridge, or \"teff polenta\". It is high in iron and calcium. About Nature\u2019s Path For over 25 years, Nature\u2019s Path has been mastering the art of whole grain baking with cereals, snacks, and waffles that are loaded with whole grain nutrition and wholesome goodness.

Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children and adults with needed energy to keep brains and bodies going throughout the day.

With a non-thirst provoking formula and a perfect balance of quality ingredients, the ER Bar provides nutrition specifically formulated for disaster victims, including an optimum balance of salt, carbohydrates, protein, fat and enriched with the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals.

      "description": "In 1971, Arran Stephens and a business partner opened Canada's first large organic supermarket, LifeStream. Founded on the ideal of serving delicious, wholesome foods grown and processed in harmony with nature, the store soon expanded into milling, baking, making muesli, granolas, alfalfa sprouts, nut butters, energy bars, and wholesale distribution. Within a few years, the LifeStream line had grown to include a wide range of products, including both natural and organic whole grain foods and soy-based vegetarian entrees. The company even published its own vegetarian cookbook, which sold over 125,000 copies. Annual sales at LifeStream reached $9 million, making the line one of Canada\u0092s leading natural food brands at the time. LifeStream sales continued to grow to $12 million, but an awkward partnership led to the sale of the company in 1981. It eventually was acquired by Kraft/Phillip Morris. Then in 1985, Arran and his wife, Ratana, started a new venture christened Nature\u0092s Path, from the back of their natural foods restaurant. The company\u0092s first product, Sprouted Organic Manna Bread, debuted at the Natural Products Expo in Anaheim, Calif. Organic Multigrain, Multigrain & Raisin, and Millet Rice Flakes were the very first Nature\u0092s Path cereals and remain as popular as ever. By 1989, building on the success of its cereals, the company had grown 800%. To meet demand, acreage was bought and a 54,000 square foot organic processing plant was built in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. This was the first third-party certified organic cereal plant in the world. Later, ten years after starting Nature's Path, the Stephens family purchased back LifeStream from Kraft. Since, the company has continue to expand its facilities and the brands and products it offers--adding waffles, additional cereals, granola and energy bars, flaxseed meal, baking mixes, and more.   Real, organic hemps seeds, sunflower seeds and raisins; all made with good stuff like whole grain oats. Packed with raisins, sunflower seeds and nutritious hemp seeds! This bar has flaxseeds and is an excellent source of Omega 3\u2019s. This could become a cult classic.

      "description": "Simply the best tasting good for you granola Whole Grain Kosher High Energy Thanks for checking out my granola, which if you're reading this, is now yours as well. The granola you're about to enjoy started out as a homemade snack I made for friends and family. I've always been big into cooking and baking, but it never occurred to me to turn the passion into a business. One day I volunteered to bake some of my treats for a school fundraiser and my signature \"original honey\" granola turned out to be such a hit, it sold out in minutes. People I'd never met before wanted to know where they could buy more, or if I could whip up another batch for their friends and family. Next thing I knew, a business was born and soon I was making and marketing my special blend of sodium and cholesterol free granola in speciality shops all over New York and on the internet. From there... well somehow my make it up as we go distribution team found its way to you and the bag you now hold in your hands. There are no fillers, salts or preservatives. It's the kind of delicious, all natural snack you can feel good about sharing with the people you love, because it was originally made for the people I love. Try some on your favorite yogurt or ice cream, enjoy it as a bowl of cereal with milk, or (my favorite) share it with your friends straight out of the bag.Crunch responsibly, Viki  ",

It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

      "description": "The PowerBar Harvest Bars taste better than the dry, cardboard substance you've gagged yourself with the last three training rides. In fact, the Powerbar Harvest Bars are so good that you may become addicted to them. It's true, although you could feasibly survive off the Harvest Bars alone (and some water to wash them down), we don't recommend it. We do however recommend that you take along a bar on your next training ride. Because after all, just because you took the afternoon off to go ride, doesn't mean your taste buds didn't come along. So how do the Harvest Bars provide energy? Easy. The Harvest Bars use a balanced mix of whole grains, soy protein, and natural fiber to keep you fueled for your ride. PowerBar claims that between 70 and 75 percent of the bars' energy is derived from carbohydrates. And as you've probably heard, carbs act like the gasoline for your body's engine. Where the Harvest Bar differs from the competition is in its aforementioned formula. The whole oats, fiber, and protein take longer to digest than glucose based carbohydrates, and this means that you receive a long, steady supply of carbs released into your bloodstream. This equates to consumable energy that simply lasts longer. The PowerBar Harvest Bars couldn't be easier to use for fuel on your next ride. Simply eat a bar 30 to 60 minutes before your ride, and then eat one every hour of your activity afterwards. No powders and no lab experiment goo food; just good, wholesome food. The PowerBar Harvest Bars are offered in a container of 15 individual bars and in the flavors Double Chocolate Crisp, Oatmeal Raisin Cookie, Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, and Toffee Chocolate Chip.

Real peanut butter and a chocolatey drizzle add great taste to Kellogg\u2019s FiberPlus Chocolate Chip Snack bars. Great for any time of day, these bars offer fiber-rich nutrition in a sweet package. With 35% of your daily fiber needs, 7 grams of whole grains, plus antioxidants vitamin E and zinc, Kellogg's FiberPlus Chocolatey Peanut Butter Bars  fuel your day nutritiously.  Fill Up on Fiber The studies are clear--fiber can help promote weight loss and healthier eating patterns, while increasing overall health: Fiber takes longer to chew and slows down the rate at which we eat--giving our bodies a chance to let us know when we are full. With fewer calories and greater bulk, high-fiber foods help us feel fuller for longer. Fiber helps keep the digestive tract clean and healthy decreasing risk of intestinal disease. Fiber-rich diets can help lower 'bad' cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and help control blood sugar levels.    Snacks Matter Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children and adults with needed energy to keep brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped FiberPlus Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Special K Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. FiberPlus Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love.  About Kellogg  Kellogg Company is a leading producer of cereal and convenience foods--a company you can rely on for great-tasting, high quality foods.

When Betty Lou started looking for treats for her children to take to school, she realized how difficult it was to find treats that were not made with refined sugar--so she set about creating her own recipes. Having never created recipes before, she began to experiment, throwing in crunchy peanut butter, a bit of honey, nuts seed, and oats. Her experiments worked: Betty Lou's new snacks caught on, and today they are produced and marketed under Betty Lou's, Inc. In addition to her original \"butter balls,\" Betty Lou's also produces granola, cookies, vegan bars, and a variety of gluten-free or dairy-free products--all made without refined sugar. Betty Lou's products make a naturally nutty snack with coffee for breakfast, or even a quick, healthy lunch. Athletes have been known to buy them for a nutritious boost of energy during training.

Made with a soft, golden baked crust of wheat and whole grain oats and filled with real apple puree and cinnamon, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer flavor everyone will love. Not only do Apple Cinnamon Nutri-Grain Bars taste great--they are packed nine essential vitamins, eight grams of whole grains, three grams of dietary fiber, and two grams of protein--in each bar. Whether you start your day with a Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar, add it to your child's lunch box as sweet nutritious treat, or enjoy it as a mid-day snack, Apple Cinnamon Nutri-Grain Bars offer more of what your body needs to live well and help you eat better all day.  A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.       Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.  About Kellogg Kellogg Company is a leading producer of cereal and convenience foods--a company you can rely on for great-tasting, high quality foods.

Made with a soft, golden baked crust of wheat and whole grain oats and filled with real blueberry puree, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer flavor everyone will love. Not only do Blueberry Nutri-Grain Bars taste great--they are packed nine essential vitamins, eight grams of whole grains, three grams of dietary fiber, and two grams of protein--in each bar. Whether you start your day with a Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar, add it to your child's lunch box as sweet nutritious treat, or enjoy it as a mid-day snack, Blueberry Nutri-Grain Bars offer more of what your body needs to live well and help you eat better all day.  A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.      Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.  About Kellogg Kellogg Company is a leading producer of cereal and convenience foods--a company you can rely on for great-tasting, high quality foods.

They also made one of the first blueberry baked goods, called Sautauthig, out of blueberries, cracked corn and water\nBlueberries are chock-full of vitamin C, fiber, manganese and antioxidants.\nRaspberry\nWhile wild raspberries can be traced back to eastern Asia during prehistoric times, with certain varieties also found in the Western Hemisphere, historians believe no one thought to cultivate their deliciousness until the 16th century.

What are the ingredients of Original Caveman Cookies? Original Caveman Cookies are made with organic honey, almond meal, walnuts, raisins, and spices.  That's it!

They are peanut-free and produced in a peanut-free facility. 4. Are your cookies gluten-free? Yes!  Our cookies are made entirely with gluten-free ingredients.

      "description": "The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise. What's in the Box PowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Milk Chocolate Brownie (Pack of 24). Performance Energy Bars Trademark Information: PowerBar\u00ae Performance Energy Bar     The original energy bar. Sustained energy for a performance edge.

A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.

Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size.

Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go.

Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.

These bars provide maximum energy to your muscles with PowerBar C2MAX dual source energy blend: a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend that's been shown to deliver 20-50% more energy to muscles than glucose alone, and can help improve endurance performance by 8%.* Endurance athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat a carbohydrate-based diet on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before exercise. If you're one of these athletes, you also need carbs to sustain your energy stores on the course. *Currell K, Jeukendrup A. Superior endurance performance with ingestion of multiple transportable carbohydrates. Med Sci Sports Exerc 2008; 40:275-281.  Do PowerBar Performance Energy Fruit and Nut Bars provide electrolytes?  Yes. Each bar contains 200 mg sodium, a key electrolyte lost when you sweat. Loss of sodium from sweating is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Average Quantities of Electrolytes Lost in Sweat: Sodium: 920-1840 mg per liter of sweat Potassium: 156-312 mg per liter Calcium: 120-160 mg per liter  Why do PowerBar Performance Energy Fruit and Nut Bars freeze?  Because PowerBar Performance Energy Fruit and Nut bars contain 1.5-4g of fat and have a water base, you may find that they freeze in colder weather. To retain its soft texture, keep your PowerBar Performance Energy Fruit and Nut Bar close to your body for warmth.  How long will my PowerBar Performance Energy Fruit and Nut Bars last?  Each PowerBar Performance Energy Fruit and Nut Bar is stamped with a \"best by\" date. We recommend that you use them by the \"best by\" date to ensure you're enjoying our best quality product and receiving the full nutritional benefits of the product.

Having never created recipes before, she began to experiment, throwing in crunchy peanut butter, a bit of honey, nuts seed, and oats. Her experiments worked: Betty Lou's new snacks caught on, and today they are produced and marketed under Betty Lou's, Inc. In addition to her original \"butter balls,\" Betty Lou's also produces granola, cookies, vegan bars, and a variety of gluten-free or dairy-free products--all made without refined sugar. Betty Lou's products make a naturally nutty snack with coffee for breakfast, or even a quick, healthy lunch. Athletes have been known to buy them for a nutritious boost of energy during training.

      "description": " EnviroKidz organic cheetah crispy rice berry bars are truly delicious gluten-free bars studded with organic freeze-dried blueberries and intense red organic raspberries--enjoy the blast of berry taste in every bite. Be sure, you will not have to lower your expectations even if you are eating a gluten-free, wheat-free snack bar. You do not have to settle for ordinary or tasteless gluten-free bars when Nature\u2019s Path offers so much more--a pinch of this, a dash of that, but never anything artificial. This product contains no artificial additives, preservatives, or colors. Moreover, the USDA organic certification on this product means that the ingredients are grown without synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and nasty chemicals. It is a sacrifice-free way of enjoying a healthy delicious snack. Whole Grain Goodness for Everyone The specialty of Nature\u2019s Path is, and has always been, everything \u201cwhole grain\u201d. If you decide to go \u201cgluten free\u201d then there is no healthier option than organic gluten free--products that are not only gluten free but also free of other things that can compromise health. Add to that, Non-GMO Project verified for an extra assurance when it comes to food safety. Nature\u2019s Path uses gluten-free grains such as buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum, amaranth, brown rice, flax, teff, and whole grain corn . Amaranth: Long considered a native crop in Peru, amaranth was a major food crop of the ancient Aztecs and played a part in their religious practices as well. Amaranth is gluten free, high in protein, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It is the only grain that also contains vitamin C. Brown Rice: Naturally gluten free, whole-grain rice is usually brown but can also be black, purple, or even red. It is one of the most easily digested grains and though it is lower in fiber, it is still rich in many other nutrients. Buckwheat: It is not technically a grain at all and not any kind of wheat, but rather, a cousin of rhubarb! It is the only grain to have high levels of an antioxidant called rutin and of course, it is gluten free too. Certified gluten free and wheat free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization, an independent service that supervises gluten-free food production according to a consistent, defined, science-based standard that is confirmed by field inspections. Nature\u2019s Path was the first USDA Certified producer of organic breakfast cereal in North America and we're the larges manufacturer of organic cereals to this day. Many of our gluten-free products are Non-GMO Project verified. GMO crops are found in so many of the foods implicated in health and digestive issues and have yet to be proven safe. We keep them out of our foods because we don\u2019t believe in using people as guinea pigs in a lab experiment. Quality Assurance International is a third party certification organization that regularly inspects to ensure stringent organic food standards are met. All Nature\u2019s Path foods are Kosher.  Whole Grain Corn: While it\u2019s true that corn may be familiar, don\u2019t overlook it when it comes to antioxidants. Corn has the highest levels of antioxidants of any grain or vegetable! Quinoa: It is another \u201cgrain\u201d that is not quite a grain. Quinoa is actually a relative of Swiss chard and beets. This gluten free grain was a favorite of the Incas. It comes from South America and is a small, light colored grain that looks a bit like sesame seeds. It is a complete protein, delivering all the essential amino acids our bodies need. Sorghum: This hearty gluten free grain from Africa thrives where other grains would wither and die. It can be eaten like popcorn, cooked into porridge, or made into flour. It is very popular with people who have gluten issues. Teff: This is a tiny grain that comes from Africa--it is 1/150th the size of a wheat kernel. The fact that \u201cteff\u201d comes from the word \u201cteffa\u201d meaning \u201clost\u201d starts to make sense. Teff has a sweet, molasses-like taste and can be used for baked goods, porridge, or \"teff polenta\". It is high in iron and calcium. About Nature\u2019s Path For over 25 years, Nature\u2019s Path has been mastering the art of whole grain baking with cereals, snacks, and waffles that are loaded with whole grain nutrition and wholesome goodness. They bake cereals with basic gluten containing grains used in typical manufacturing such as barley, rye, and oats. Out of the 128 innovative products that Nature\u2019s Path makes twenty percent are certified gluten free--and many of these products are also whole grain. Organic is Healthier Organic makes much less impact on the Earth as no synthetic pesticides fertilizers or antibiotics are used and no chemicals are added to the food afterwards. It means less pollution in your world and in your bowl. Organic goes further towards giving you what nature intended--clean, pure, and real food. Nature\u2019s Path has made America\u2019s favorite gluten-free cereals for longer than anyone else has. Nobody offers a wider range of gluten free breakfast options--they know what makes a great tasting breakfast. You can make Nature\u2019s Path your daily breakfast partner today!

The USDA, through the National Organic Program (NOP) has established a uniform set of production methods for growing and processing organic food. If farmers and manufacturers meet these standards, which include annual on-site inspections by third-party inspectors, a farm's crops or food are certified to be organic. If a food product has between 95 percent to 100 percent organic content, it may be called organic and the USDA/NOP Organic Seal may be used on the package.    Gluten Free  Low Fat  Low Sodium  No Trans Fat  Vegetarian     Why Should My Family Go Organic? Choosing organic products for your family is one of the easiest things you can do to protect our environment. Simply put, organic agriculture is easier on the planet than non-organic farming. With organic cultivation methods, no chemicals are released into the air or groundwater where they can contribute to global warming and animal endangerment. On top of enjoying the environmental benefits of going organic, most people agree that organic foods just taste better than non-organic foods. It might seem obvious, but without pesticide residues, it's amazing how much better food can taste. Take a bite of a Peanut Butter Panda bar and see for yourself!

These beautiful little bouncing balls, bursting with goodness, are perfect all year round. Slightly sweetened to make them less sharp and acidic, these normally festive friends are filled with fruitiness. Macadamias All our macadamia nuts come from family-run farms in South Africa - where they are lovingly nurtured and carefully harvested by hand. Their lovely creamy taste is also enjoyed by the local monkeys, who have trees planted just for them. All Eat Natural Bars are made with love and care from simple ingredients, in small batches at our own Makery. We never use artificial flavours, colours or preservatives. Here at Eat Natural, when we say 'natural', what exactly do we mean? Well, clearly it would be wrong of us to claim that everything in this bar is '100% natural' and simply 'grows on trees'. Obviously, some ingredients need to be cleaned, dried and roasted too, and therefore, to some extent, 'processed'. It's just that we believe, the less we mess with it. the better it tastes.

      "description": "The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

When Betty Lou started looking for treats for her children to take to school, she realized how difficult it was to find treats that were not made with refined sugar--so she set about creating her own recipes. Having never created recipes before, she began to experiment, throwing in crunchy peanut butter, a bit of honey, nuts seed, and oats. Her experiments worked: Betty Lou's new snacks caught on, and today they are produced and marketed under Betty Lou's, Inc. In addition to her original \"butter balls,\" Betty Lou's also produces granola, cookies, vegan bars, and a variety of gluten-free or dairy-free products--all made without refined sugar. Betty Lou's products make a naturally nutty snack with coffee for breakfast, or even a quick, healthy lunch. Athletes have been known to buy them for a nutritious boost of energy during training.

The L\u00c4RABAR Story  Lara Merriken was hiking in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado when inspiration struck: create a new kind of nutrition bar using wholesome, natural ingredients. In May 2000, L\u00c4RABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each invidual package by hand-- all 500 of them! Although L\u00c4RABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.

Real peanut butter and a chocolatey drizzle add great taste to Kellogg\u2019s FiberPlus Chocolate Chip Snack bars. Great for any time of day, these bars offer fiber-rich nutrition in a sweet package. With 35% of your daily fiber needs, 7 grams of whole grains, plus antioxidants vitamin E and zinc, Kellogg's FiberPlus Chocolatey Peanut Butter Bars  fuel your day nutritiously.  Fill Up on Fiber The studies are clear--fiber can help promote weight loss and healthier eating patterns, while increasing overall health: Fiber takes longer to chew and slows down the rate at which we eat--giving our bodies a chance to let us know when we are full. With fewer calories and greater bulk, high-fiber foods help us feel fuller for longer. Fiber helps keep the digestive tract clean and healthy decreasing risk of intestinal disease. Fiber-rich diets can help lower 'bad' cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and help control blood sugar levels.    Snacks Matter Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children and adults with needed energy to keep brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped FiberPlus Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Special K Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. FiberPlus Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love.  About Kellogg  Kellogg Company is a leading producer of cereal and convenience foods--a company you can rely on for great-tasting, high quality foods. Kellogg was founded in 1906, in Battle Creek, Michigan. For more than 100 years, innovation and their commitment to being the best has guided the company. From being the first company to offer premiums in cereal boxes to being the first to fortify the cereals, Kellogg has historically been a leader in industry, innovation, and marketing. The founder, W.K. Kellogg, had a strong commitment to nutrition, health, and quality. His vision continues to drive improvement in the products and processes, with the goal of providing great-tasting, nutritious products that meet the most rigorous quality standards. With more than 100 ready-to-eat cereals around the world, consumers count on Kellogg for great-tasting, convenient, and affordable choices that meet their nutrition needs.    ",

A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.

Entering this new phase of being a mother, I needed a quick snack that provided nourishment and energy for my busy day.  In pursuing a degree in dietetics, I came to understand how food can have a large effect on our body functions and overall health.  With this knowledge I saw the importance of eating healthy for both my son and I.  It was shortly after, that I began experimenting with different recipes that consisted of our macro nutrients, protein, fat and carbohydrates.  In wanting to have all variations of those three nutrients, I started with using 100 % natural ingredients, consisting of oats for the protein, butter for the fat, and sugar, agave, maple syrup, and fruit as my sweeteners and carbohydrates. I wanted something nutritious and yummy.\nI saw oats very differently than most.  To me, it was like working with a cake mix, \"very neutral\".  Meaning, whatever flavor is added to the oats it will take on that flavor.  At that point I began thinking of deserts, candy, popular junk cereal that I knew one day my son would desire and therefore I mimicked those with a healthy twist.  This granola is 100% natural with 100% usable energy. \nWith a variety of different flavors, the yummy line was created for not just adults but for children alike. Amazingly Rani's Yummy appeals to people who are not generally fond of granola!  ",

And what you eat is most delicious and satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state.  L\u00c4RABAR \u00fcber is a unique sweet and salty snack made from whole fruits and nuts. It\u2019s big texture with big taste!  Roasted Nut Roll  It\u2019s true, we're nuts about nuts over here at L\u00c4RABAR, and Roasted Nut Roll is a sure sign that we are still as passionate about them as ever. A sweet and salty standout, the shining stars of this bar are the almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans, and macadamia nuts that bring the crunch and the flavor we go nuts for.  Roasted Nut Roll is made with almonds, cashews, brown rice syrup, peanuts, dates, pecans, roasted macadamia nuts, honey, and sea salt.      view larger   The L\u00c4RABAR Story  Lara Merriken was hiking in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado when inspiration struck: create a new kind of nutrition bar using wholesome, natural ingredients. In May 2000, L\u00c4RABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each invidual package by hand-- all 500 of them! Although L\u00c4RABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.

At Larabar(R), we delight in creating delicious flavors from just a few carefully chosen ingredients. So, when we set out to make a sweet and salty bar with added crunch, we knew it had to have big pieces of nuts and fruits and big taste. It was a simple idea, but the result was nothing short of magic. We're excited to present Uber(TM), the ultimate in Simple. Pure. Delicious.(R)  ",

In a word, convenient. At the forefront of that energy-bar movement was Powerbar and its line of Performance Bars. While most of those energy-bar start ups have quietly disappeared, Powerbar, like one of its sponsored endurance athletes, has soldiered on. This is because Powerbar has continually fine tuned its flavors and formula to ease digestion while providing nutritional benefits for high-intensity athletes. Fore example, each low-fat bar contains 200mg of sodium-based electrolytes to help the body efficiently replenish its water supply. This helps prevent dehydration when exercising or competing in extreme conditions. But, that's just one advantage these energy-bars bring to serious endurance athletes. Through extensive research and development, Powerbar's optimized a glucose to fructose blend with a two-to-one ratio for efficient and long-lasting energy. What they've coined C2MAX, this dual-source energy blend helps supply more energy to muscles than glucose alone. In fact, testing by Med Sci Sports Exerc journal as shown this ratio to deliver 20 - 50 percent more energy to muscles, and improve endurance performance by eight percent.

The inclusion of oats as part of a diet low in saturated fat and a healthy lifestyle contributes to a healthy cholesterol level. One serving (30g) of Oatibix Flakes provides 0.9g of beta glucan soluble fibre from wholegrain oats, which is about one third of the suggested daily intake (3g). Oatibix Flakes are delicious with lashings of cold milk. If you fancy something different why not try our Raisin, Cranberry & Blackcurrant Oatibix Flakes or our Oatibix Bites, full of the same 100% wholegrain goodness and just as tasty.

It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

      "description": "     Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Raspberry Cereal Bars Low on calories, high on nutrition, Nutri-Grain Raspberry Cereal Bars get you on track with energy in a quick and easy package. Made with a soft, golden baked crust of wheat and whole grain oats and filled with real raspberry puree, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer flavor everyone will love. Not only do Raspberry Nutri-Grain Bars taste great--they are packed nine essential vitamins, eight grams of whole grains, three grams of dietary fiber, and two grams of protein--in each bar. Whether you start your day with a Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar, add it to your child's lunch box as sweet nutritious treat, or enjoy it as a mid-day snack, Raspberry Nutri-Grain Bars offer more of what your body needs to live well and help you eat better all day.  A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.       Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.  About Kellogg Kellogg Company is a leading producer of cereal and convenience foods--a company you can rely on for great-tasting, high quality foods.

Let's not wash over them. There's some pretty tasty bits and bobs crammed into that reassuringly tiny list. Some big old nuts, and a whole load of huge, juicy sultanas and apricots and a healthy dollop of honey. Pretty straightforward maybe...but also pretty special, if you ask me.\n\nSimple... isn't it?\n\nDown here at the Eat Natural Makery, when we say 'natural', what exactly do we mean? Well, clearly it would be wrong of us to claim that everything in this bar is '100% natural' yoghurt coating, glucose and crisped rice simply don't grow on trees. Obviously, everything needs to be cleaned, dried and roasted too, and therefore, to some extent, 'processed'.

      "description": "Before Thunderbird Energetica existed, one of its founders, Katie, had a problem to solve: she was training for the Ironman World Championships with a severely sore and inflamed knee, and she found that the artificial ingredients in so many available nutritional products only made it worse. She and her husband experimented with various ingredients to make their own bars with entirely natural ingredients that didn't provoke her injury, and the result turned into Thunderbird Energetica Bars. The rest, as they say, is history. So what's the connection between a knee injury and organic ingredients? The body requires proper nutrition to heal, to train, and to recover, and the synthesized proteins and sugars in lots of the products out there not only impede the body's ability to heal itself, but can irritate it in the process. Thunderbird Energetica bars are made from nature's most nutrient-dense ingredients, and being that each ingredient is entirely raw (never heated above 115 degrees Fahrenheit), they retain all of the natural enzymes that are normally broken down when cooked. Your body can thoroughly utilize the entire bar, as opposed to the small percentage of the ingredients in many of the market's artificially-sourced bars. The bottom line: a small bar that packs a big punch. Thunderbird Energetica Bars are mostly fruit- and nut-based. They are sweeter in taste and have higher glycemic levels for a more immediate, less sustained boost of energy when compared to the company's line of Gather bars. Each bar comes in a 100%-compostable wrapper. All flavors are free of GMOs, agave, soy, gluten, and are vegan. Bars come in boxes of 15 and are available in six flavors: Sweet Lemon Rain Dance, Hyper Hawaiian Crunch, Cherry Walnut Crunch, Cashew Fig Carrot, Cacao Hemp Walnut, and Almond Cookie Pow-Wow.  ",

Made with a soft, golden baked crust of wheat and whole grain oats and filled with real blueberry puree, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer flavor everyone will love. Not only do Blueberry Nutri-Grain Bars taste great--they are packed nine essential vitamins, eight grams of whole grains, three grams of dietary fiber, and two grams of protein--in each bar. Whether you start your day with a Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar, add it to your child's lunch box as sweet nutritious treat, or enjoy it as a mid-day snack, Blueberry Nutri-Grain Bars offer more of what your body needs to live well and help you eat better all day.  A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.      Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.  About Kellogg Kellogg Company is a leading producer of cereal and convenience foods--a company you can rely on for great-tasting, high quality foods.

It\u2019s big texture with big taste!  Coconunt Macaroon  The sweet crunch of coconut is irresistible, and this Coconut Macaroon proves it. From the first bite to the last, experience the perfect combination of\u00a0crunchy\u00a0and\u00a0chewy\u2013just the way a macaroon should be.

The L\u00c4RABAR Story  Lara Merriken was hiking in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado when inspiration struck: create a new kind of nutrition bar using wholesome, natural ingredients. In May 2000, L\u00c4RABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each individual package by hand \u2014 all 500 of them! Although L\u00c4RABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.    Coconut Macaroon is also:   Gluten Free  Non-GMO  Kosher         \u00dcber - synonyms: super duper, wicked awesome, seriously epic. At L\u00c4RABAR, we delight in creating delicious flavors from just a few carefully chosen ingredients. So, when we set out to make a sweet and salty bar with added crunch, we knew it had to have big pieces of nuts and fruits and big taste. It was a simple idea, but the result was nothing short of magic. We're excited to present \u00fcber, the ultimate in SIMPLE. PURE. DELICIOUS.     ",

But despite our best efforts, there weren\u2019t any on the market we really liked.  If a particular bar was nutritionally balanced, it left something to be desired in the taste department. If it tasted good, it was low in protein and fiber, or full of artificial ingredients, unhealthy fats and empty calories.  Then we came up with a deliciously different idea.  We could create our own all-natural nutrition bar. Our take on the perfect snack.  A bar with everything we wanted it to have, and nothing we didn\u2019t.  A healthy balance of carbs, protein and beneficial fats, but no artificial sweeteners, colors or preservatives.  No trans fats, synthetic vitamins, or allergy-aggravating gluten, wheat or soy protein.  In short, a nutrition bar that everyone-including nutritionists and other healthcare professionals-could love. Zing! Now we hope you love it too.  ",

Be sure, you will not have to lower your expectations even if you are eating a gluten-free, wheat-free snack bar. You do not have to settle for ordinary or tasteless gluten-free bars when Nature\u2019s Path offers so much more--a pinch of this, a dash of that, but never anything artificial. This product contains no artificial additives, preservatives, or colors. Moreover, the USDA organic certification on this product means that the ingredients are grown without synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and nasty chemicals.  It is a sacrifice-free way of enjoying a healthy delicious snack. Whole Grain Goodness for Everyone The specialty of Nature\u2019s Path is, and has always been, everything \u201cwhole grain\u201d. If you decide to go \u201cgluten free\u201d then there is no healthier option than organic gluten free--products that are not only gluten free but also free of other things that can compromise health. Add to that, Non-GMO Project verified for an extra assurance when it comes to food safety. Nature\u2019s Path uses gluten-free grains such as buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum, amaranth, brown rice, flax, teff, and whole grain corn . Amaranth: Long considered a native crop in Peru, amaranth was a major food crop of the ancient Aztecs and played a part in their religious practices as well. Amaranth is gluten free, high in protein, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It is the only grain that also contains vitamin C. Brown Rice: Naturally gluten free, whole-grain rice is usually brown but can also be black, purple, or even red. It is one of the most easily digested grains and though it is lower in fiber, it is still rich in many other nutrients. Buckwheat: It is not technically a grain at all and not any kind of wheat, but rather, a cousin of rhubarb! It is the only grain to have high levels of an antioxidant called rutin and of course, it is gluten free too. Certified gluten free and wheat free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization, an independent service that supervises gluten-free food production according to a consistent, defined, science-based standard that is confirmed by field inspections. Nature\u2019s Path was the first USDA Certified producer of organic breakfast cereal in North America and we're the larges manufacturer of organic cereals to this day. Many of our gluten-free products are Non-GMO Project verified. GMO crops are found in so many of the foods implicated in health and digestive issues and have yet to be proven safe. We keep them out of our foods because we don\u2019t believe in using people as guinea pigs in a lab experiment. Quality Assurance International is a third party certification organization that regularly inspects to ensure stringent organic food standards are met. All Nature\u2019s Path foods are Kosher.  Whole Grain Corn: While it\u2019s true that corn may be familiar, don\u2019t overlook it when it comes to antioxidants. Corn has the highest levels of antioxidants of any grain or vegetable! Quinoa: It is another \u201cgrain\u201d that is not quite a grain. Quinoa is actually a relative of Swiss chard and beets. This gluten free grain was a favorite of the Incas. It comes from South America and is a small, light colored grain that looks a bit like sesame seeds. It is a complete protein, delivering all the essential amino acids our bodies need. Sorghum: This hearty gluten free grain from Africa thrives where other grains would wither and die. It can be eaten like popcorn, cooked into porridge, or made into flour. It is very popular with people who have gluten issues. Teff: This is a tiny grain that comes from Africa--it is 1/150th the size of a wheat kernel. The fact that \u201cteff\u201d comes from the word \u201cteffa\u201d meaning \u201clost\u201d starts to make sense. Teff has a sweet, molasses-like taste and can be used for baked goods, porridge, or \"teff polenta\". It is high in iron and calcium. About Nature\u2019s Path For over 25 years, Nature\u2019s Path has been mastering the art of whole grain baking with cereals, snacks, and waffles that are loaded with whole grain nutrition and wholesome goodness. They bake cereals with basic gluten containing grains used in typical manufacturing such as barley, rye, and oats. Out of the 128 innovative products that Nature\u2019s Path makes twenty percent are certified gluten free--and many of these products are also whole grain. Organic is Healthier Organic makes much less impact on the Earth as no synthetic pesticides fertilizers or antibiotics are used and no chemicals are added to the food afterwards. It means less pollution in your world and in your bowl. Organic goes further towards giving you what nature intended--clean, pure, and real food. Nature\u2019s Path has made America\u2019s favorite gluten-free cereals for longer than anyone else has. Nobody offers a wider range of gluten free breakfast options--they know what makes a great tasting breakfast. You can make Nature\u2019s Path your daily breakfast partner today!

But aside from the waffle pattern and round shape, the differences are perhaps greater than the similarities. Honey Stinger's Waffles are created just for endurance athletes, not merely as a tasty morning snack. And that they're packaged in single serving units makes them easy to carry in your jersey pocket for that moment when you'd like to eat something with a bit of texture. The Stinger Waffles are simultaneously toasty and chewy as you eat them. And unlike bizarre lab-born products, the natural ingredients in the Waffles chew easily and go down quick -- almost too quick. Because they taste so good, you'd like for them to last a bit longer. Like their other energy foods, the Honey Stinger Waffles rely on honey, nature's energy food, for a majority of the carbohydrate load. The honey is easily digested because it's made of a just-right 1:1 blend of fructose and glucose. It acts quickly to give you a burst of energy and is easy on the stomach. With the waffle, you'll also get carbs from organic wheat and soy flour along with organic cane sugar and rice syrup. Honey Stinger Organic Stinger Waffles are packaged in a box of 16 individually wrapped waffles. They come in Honey, Vanilla, Chocolate, Lemon, and Strawberry flavors and are a great on and off the bike snack.

      "description": "The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been clinically proven to outperform glucose alone. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

      "description": "It started out as just a hike, no different than countless others I've taken into the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Little did I know I was about to come up with a mountain of an idea: Combine wholesome ingredients such as fruits and nuts to create a food product that's tasty, healthy and convenient. In that instant, in May 2000, L\u00c4RABAR was born. After scouring the aisles of grocery stores and noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, I delved into my own product development. Natural foods, I believed, should be fun and enjoyable as well as good for you. With friends and family serving as focus groups, I tinkered with recipes until a consensus on yummi-ness was reached. The next step was to launch a company to market what would initially be five delicious L\u00c4RABAR flavors: Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. I also assembled a sophisticated manufacturing arm...what amounted to be a Cuisinart and a rolling pin. The first batch of bars I produced for retail had to be sealed by hand - all 500 of them! Thank goodness we have machines for that job today. After all, we're producing millions of L\u00c4RABAR's every year. They are a healthy indulgence you can feel good about eating. And \"feeling good\" is what it's all about. Believe it or not, I used to be a junk food junkie - until I discovered how natural foods enlivened my mind, body and spirit. A passion for healthy living soon followed, and continues to be a driving force behind everything I do professionally and personally. I really appreciate the opportunity I have to make a positive difference in the world we live in. Health is indeed your greatest wealth. Lara, CEO/ Founder                Simple. Pure. Delicious.  At L\u00c4RABAR, we believe that the foundation of a sound mind, body, and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is most delicious and satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state.  L\u00c4RABAR J\u00f6calat is an organic chocolate food bar made from fruits, nuts, and Fair Trade Certified chocolate. Each flavor contains no more than six simple, organic ingredients that are deliciously rich, without added sugars and free of dairy, soy, and gluten.  Chocolate  Nourish your cocoa-loving soul with the richness of organic chocolate. Blended with dates and nuts, this delightful treat provides a quarter cup of fruit, 5 grams of fiber and 15% of the recommended daily value of Magnesium.  Chocolate is made with Organic Dates, Organic Almonds, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Powder, and Organic Walnuts.                         The L\u00c4RABAR Story  Lara Merriken was hiking in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado when inspiration struck: create a new kind of nutrition bar using wholesome, natural ingredients. In May 2000, L\u00c4RABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each individual package by hand \u2014 all 500 of them! Although L\u00c4RABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.    Chocolate is also:   Gluten Free  Non-GMO  Kosher  Fair Trade Certified           Product Description  As indulgent as a fudge brownie. The richness comes from pure organic chocolate and luscious cashews - the satisfying crunch from almonds, walnuts, and whole cacao beans. Other benefits: 5 grams of natural fiber, more than 20% of the recommended daily value, as well as the almonds' 3 grams of Omega 6 essential fatty acids, and Vitamin E. Dates contribute to the 13 essential vitamins and minerals, and cashews are rich in iron, zinc and B Vitamins. Who knew a brownie could be so good for you?     ",

With family favorite flavors like Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, S\u2019mores, and Oatmeal Raisin Chewy Granola Bars in each box, and 8g of whole grains in each bar, your family has tasty choices to help keep them going.   What Are Whole Grains?  Do you know the difference between whole grains and refined grains? Many people do not.  Refined grains do not contain all parts of the grain. During the milling process, the bran and germ are removed, leaving only the endosperm. This results in refined grains, which contain less fiber and fewer vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytonutrients than whole grains. Whole grains have not had their bran and germ removed by the milling process, which makes them a richer source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals.  The Structure of a Whole Grain  Whole grains contain all three parts of the grain \u2013 the germ, endosperm and bran. The nutrients contained in whole grains work together to provide you with the maximum health benefits.  Bran: The bran consists of the coarse outer layers of the kernel. It contains the greatest amount of fiber and is a rich source of vitamins and nutrients. Endosperm: The endosperm is the largest section and the middle layer of the kernel. It is the main energy source of the plant. Germ: The germ is the embryo of the plant in its early stages. It is the heart of the grain and the smallest part of the kernel, but it is loaded with nutrients.  Tips for Adding Whole Grains to Your Diet  Whole grains are versatile and can be easily incorporated into a healthy lifestyle. A variety of whole grain foods are available at your grocery store. Here are a few simple ways you can add whole grains to your diet:  Substitute whole grain products, such as pasta or bread, for their refined counterparts. Choose whole grain, high fiber cereals for breakfast, such as oatmeal or shredded wheat. Try substituting whole wheat or oat flour for up to half the flour in flour-based recipes. Build your favorite sandwich on whole wheat bread or rolls instead of white bread. Add whole oats or crushed whole wheat crackers to your meatloaf recipe. Toast oats and grains to enhance their natural nutty flavor before using them as a crunchy topping for your salad or yogurt. Use rolled oats or crushed unsweetened whole grain cereal as breading for baked chicken or fish recipes. Add barley or wild rice in your favorite soup, stew and casserole recipes.     ",

      "description": " McCann\u2019s steel cut Irish oatmeal is the original and best oatmeal in the world. This is the classic Irish oatmeal--nothing added and nothing taken away--just pure goodness. If you are looking for great tasting oats, then go no further than McCann's steel cut Irish oatmeal. Imagine taking the best oats, removing the outer husk, and then cutting them into smaller pieces--that is all they do! That is why McCann's steel cut oats are so rich and wholesome, with their unique, nutty taste--there is no processing, no addition, and nothing artificial. The cut grain of steel cut oats means they take longer to cook than rolled oats--but the distinctive texture makes it all worthwhile! This is sold in a pack of four 28-ounce tins. About McCann\u2019s The story of McCann's dates back to 1800 when John McCann built a mill at Beamond, on the east coast of Ireland. John McCann's Irish oatmeal secured many prizes for its excellent quality over the years and the company continued to grow steadily. A piece of McCann\u2019s history was created in August 2005 when for the first time production of the trademark 28-ounce tin of steel cut oats exceeded 1 million tins for a twelve month period. McCann\u2019s has been making the classic oatmeal product for more than 150 years - and it has changed very little in that time--it is still the same real thing. McCann\u2019s is best known for its classic steel cut oats packed in the iconic 28-ounce tin. However, there are many other tasty products available--quick cooking oatmeal, instant oatmeal, and oat bran. All McCann\u2019s products are non-GMO. They are specially grown by local farmers--there are no GMO oat crops grown in Ireland.    World's Columbian Exhibition. Certificate of award. Uniformity of granulation. Oatmeal is a low saturated fat, sodium free, cholesterol free food and a good source of fiber. Contains 2g of total fat per serving. N. B. To ensure characteristic rich nutty flavour, avoid overcooking. Product of Ireland.  ",

The granola you're about to enjoy started out as a homemade snack I made for friends and family. I've always been big into cooking and baking, but it never occurred to me to turn the passion into a business. One day I volunteered to bake some of my treats for a school fundraiser and my signature \"original honey\" granola turned out to be such a hit, it sold out in minutes. People I'd never met before wanted to know where they could buy more, or if I could whip up another batch for their friends and family. Next thing I knew, a business was born and soon I was making and marketing my special blend of sodium and cholesterol free granola in speciality shops all over New York and on the internet. From there... well somehow my make it up as we go distribution team found its way to you and the bag you now hold in your hands. There are no fillers, salts or preservatives. It's the kind of delicious, all natural snack you can feel good about sharing with the people you love, because it was originally made for the people I love. Try some on your favorite yogurt or ice cream, enjoy it as a bowl of cereal with milk, or (my favorite) share it with your friends straight out of the bag.Crunch responsibly, Viki  ",

It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

Milk chocolate The unique and exclusive recipe for our gorgeously smooth, melt-in-the-mouth milk chocolate, has been lovingly created to perfectly enhance the fabulous feast of fruits and nuts in this bar. Its sweet, velvet creaminess is simply heavenly. Peanuts Has there ever been a food quite as under-rated as the humble little peanut? We adore these lovable legumes - so much flavour and crunchiness in a perfect little package, with more protein than any type of nut. 'Willpower' they say, 'is the ability to eat just one'. Cranberries A cranberry is not just for Christmas you know? These beautiful little bouncing balls, bursting with goodness, are perfect all year round. Slightly sweetened to make them less sharp and acidic, these normally festive friends are filled with fruitiness. Cashews If you think they're just 'big posh peanuts' you couldn't be more wrong. Whilst peanuts are legumes that grow underground, cashew nuts are actually the shelled seeds of the exotic cashew apple - a tree-grown fruit and a delicacy in Goa, where ours originate. All Eat natural bars are made with love and care from simple ingredients, in small batches at our own Makery. We never use artificial flavours, colours or preservatives. Here at Eat Natural, when we say 'natural', what exactly do we mean? Well, clearly it would be wrong of us to claim that everything in this bar is '100% natural' and simply 'grows on trees'. Obviously, some ingredients need to be cleaned, dried and roasted too, and therefore, to some extent, 'processed'. It's just that we believe, the less we mess with it.. the better it tastes. That's why we never add any artificial flavours or colours, or any preservatives. Find us on Facebook Twitter@EatNaturalBars  ",

Little did I know I was about to come up with a mountain of an idea: Combine wholesome ingredients such as fruits and nuts to create a food product that's tasty, healthy and convenient. In that instant, in May 2000, L\u00c4RABAR was born. After scouring the aisles of grocery stores and noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, I delved into my own product development. Natural foods, I believed, should be fun and enjoyable as well as good for you. With friends and family serving as focus groups, I tinkered with recipes until a consensus on yummi-ness was reached. The next step was to launch a company to market what would initially be five delicious L\u00c4RABAR flavors: Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. I also assembled a sophisticated manufacturing arm...what amounted to be a Cuisinart and a rolling pin. The first batch of bars I produced for retail had to be sealed by hand - all 500 of them! Thank goodness we have machines for that job today. After all, we're producing millions of L\u00c4RABAR's every year. They are a healthy indulgence you can feel good about eating. And \"feeling good\" is what it's all about. Believe it or not, I used to be a junk food junkie - until I discovered how natural foods enlivened my mind, body and spirit. A passion for healthy living soon followed, and continues to be a driving force behind everything I do professionally and personally. I really appreciate the opportunity I have to make a positive difference in the world we live in. Health is indeed your greatest wealth. Lara, CEO/ Founder                Simple. Pure. Delicious.  At L\u00c4RABAR, we believe that the foundation of a sound mind, body, and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is most delicious and satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state.  L\u00c4RABAR J\u00f6calat is an organic chocolate food bar made from fruits, nuts, and Fair Trade Certified chocolate. Each flavor contains no more than six simple, organic ingredients that are deliciously rich, without added sugars and free of dairy, soy, and gluten.  Chocolate Mint  Delight in the taste of organic chocolate with a burst of cool peppermint. Just like the mint cookies of your childhood, plus the added benefit of a quarter cup of fruit, 5 grams of fiber and 15% of the recommended daily value of Magnesium.  Chocolate Mint is made with Organic Dates, Organic Almonds, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Powder, Organic Vanilla Flavor, and Organic Peppermint Flavor.                          The L\u00c4RABAR Story  Lara Merriken was hiking in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado when inspiration struck: create a new kind of nutrition bar using wholesome, natural ingredients. In May 2000, L\u00c4RABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each individual package by hand \u2014 all 500 of them! Although L\u00c4RABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.    Chocolate Mint is also:   Gluten Free  Non-GMO  Kosher  Fair Trade Certified           Product Description  Decadent like the mint cookies you grew up on. The indulgence begins with pure organic chocolate and a satisfying crunch of almonds and whole cacao beans, then finishes with a cool burst of peppermint, known to aid in digestion and detoxification. The nutritional numbers are also exciting. 6 grams of natural fiber, 22% of the recommended daily value, as well as the almonds' 1.5 grams of Omega 6 essential fatty acids and Vitamin E. Dates contribute to the 13 essential vitamins and minerals. Go ahead, eat two!     ",

      "description": "The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

Chocolate chips and gooey whole-grain goodness add great taste to Kellogg\u2019s FiberPlus Chocolate Chip Snack bars. Great for any time of day, these bars offer fiber-rich nutrition in a sweet   package. With 35% of your daily fiber needs, 7 grams of whole grains, plus antioxidants vitamin E and zinc, Kellogg's FiberPlus Chocolate Chip Bars  fuel your day nutritiously.  Fill Up on Fiber The studies are clear--fiber can help promote weight loss and healthier eating patterns, while increasing overall health: Fiber takes longer to chew and slows down the rate at which we eat--giving our bodies a chance to let us know when we are full. With fewer calories and greater bulk, high-fiber foods help us feel fuller for longer. Fiber helps keep the digestive tract clean and healthy decreasing risk of intestinal disease. Fiber-rich diets can help lower 'bad' cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and help control blood sugar levels.    Snacks Matter Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children and adults with needed energy to keep brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped FiberPlus Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Special K Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. FiberPlus Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love.  About Kellogg  Kellogg Company is a leading producer of cereal and convenience foods--a company you can rely on for great-tasting, high quality foods.

Be sure, you will not have to lower your expectations even if you are eating a gluten-free, wheat-free snack bar. You do not have to settle for ordinary or tasteless gluten-free bars when Nature\u2019s Path offers so much more--a pinch of this, a dash of that, but never anything artificial. This product contains no artificial additives, preservatives, or colors. Moreover, the USDA organic certification on this product means that the ingredients are grown without synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and nasty chemicals.  It is a sacrifice-free way of enjoying a healthy delicious snack. Whole Grain Goodness for Everyone The specialty of Nature\u2019s Path is, and has always been, everything \u201cwhole grain\u201d. If you decide to go \u201cgluten free\u201d then there is no healthier option than organic gluten free--products that are not only gluten free but also free of other things that can compromise health. Add to that, Non-GMO Project verified for an extra assurance when it comes to food safety. Nature\u2019s Path uses gluten-free grains such as buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum, amaranth, brown rice, flax, teff, and whole grain corn . Amaranth: Long considered a native crop in Peru, amaranth was a major food crop of the ancient Aztecs and played a part in their religious practices as well. Amaranth is gluten free, high in protein, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It is the only grain that also contains vitamin C. Brown Rice: Naturally gluten free, whole-grain rice is usually brown but can also be black, purple, or even red. It is one of the most easily digested grains and though it is lower in fiber, it is still rich in many other nutrients. Buckwheat: It is not technically a grain at all and not any kind of wheat, but rather, a cousin of rhubarb! It is the only grain to have high levels of an antioxidant called rutin and of course, it is gluten free too. Certified gluten free and wheat free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization, an independent service that supervises gluten-free food production according to a consistent, defined, science-based standard that is confirmed by field inspections. Nature\u2019s Path was the first USDA Certified producer of organic breakfast cereal in North America and we're the larges manufacturer of organic cereals to this day. Many of our gluten-free products are Non-GMO Project verified. GMO crops are found in so many of the foods implicated in health and digestive issues and have yet to be proven safe. We keep them out of our foods because we don\u2019t believe in using people as guinea pigs in a lab experiment. Quality Assurance International is a third party certification organization that regularly inspects to ensure stringent organic food standards are met. All Nature\u2019s Path foods are Kosher.  Whole Grain Corn: While it\u2019s true that corn may be familiar, don\u2019t overlook it when it comes to antioxidants. Corn has the highest levels of antioxidants of any grain or vegetable! Quinoa: It is another \u201cgrain\u201d that is not quite a grain. Quinoa is actually a relative of Swiss chard and beets. This gluten free grain was a favorite of the Incas. It comes from South America and is a small, light colored grain that looks a bit like sesame seeds. It is a complete protein, delivering all the essential amino acids our bodies need. Sorghum: This hearty gluten free grain from Africa thrives where other grains would wither and die. It can be eaten like popcorn, cooked into porridge, or made into flour. It is very popular with people who have gluten issues. Teff: This is a tiny grain that comes from Africa--it is 1/150th the size of a wheat kernel. The fact that \u201cteff\u201d comes from the word \u201cteffa\u201d meaning \u201clost\u201d starts to make sense. Teff has a sweet, molasses-like taste and can be used for baked goods, porridge, or \"teff polenta\". It is high in iron and calcium. About Nature\u2019s Path For over 25 years, Nature\u2019s Path has been mastering the art of whole grain baking with cereals, snacks, and waffles that are loaded with whole grain nutrition and wholesome goodness. They bake cereals with basic gluten containing grains used in typical manufacturing such as barley, rye, and oats. Out of the 128 innovative products that Nature\u2019s Path makes twenty percent are certified gluten free--and many of these products are also whole grain. Organic is Healthier Organic makes much less impact on the Earth as no synthetic pesticides fertilizers or antibiotics are used and no chemicals are added to the food afterwards. It means less pollution in your world and in your bowl. Organic goes further towards giving you what nature intended--clean, pure, and real food.

It is a 100% vegetable food, containing 92% dried extracted juices of organically grown cereal grasses: barley, oats, rye and wheat (no chemical fertilizers or insecticides are used); and 8% papain, beets and sea kelp. The grasses are cut at the young, rapidly growing stage, when the maximum nutrition is in the blade. The juice is extracted from the grass, chilled, and dried to a powder by a low-heat, vacuum dry process. GreenLife is made without the use of fillers, binders, or synthetic drying agents, such as maltodextrin (sugar). Every known precaution is taken to preserve the integrity and freshness of the vitamins, minerals, and enzymes naturally present in the dried juice. GreenLife is bottled in inert amber glass bottles to block light and prevent nutrient reactivity with plastic, and sealed with nitrogen to prevent oxidation. We use cereal grass - not the grain - so there is no gluten, making it is safe for individuals with wheat allergies. GreenLife is a concentrated product, retaining its natural balance as a complete all-food supplement. It is nontoxic in any consumable amount, and helps balance nutritional deficiencies resulting from consumption of devitalized and processed foods.*    GreenLife is available in tablets (#10) and in powder form (#11).

Made with a soft, golden baked crust of wheat and whole grain oats and filled with real strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry purees, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer flavor everyone will love. Not only do Mixed Berry Nutri-Grain Bars taste great--they are packed nine essential vitamins, eight grams of whole grains, three grams of dietary fiber, and two grams of protein--in each bar. Whether you start your day with a Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar, add it to your child's lunch box as sweet nutritious treat, or enjoy it as a mid-day snack, Mixed Berry Nutri-Grain Bars offer more of what your body needs to live well and help you eat better all day.  A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.       Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.  About Kellogg Kellogg Company is a leading producer of cereal and convenience foods--a company you can rely on for great-tasting, high quality foods.
