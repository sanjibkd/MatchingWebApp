Its bittersweet flavour is so floral and fruity, you'd think it was picked from the same trees. Brazils Brazil nuts only ever grow wild in the forest - they just can't be cultivated like other nuts. As far as we're concerned, that makes them pretty special. When it comes to their taste, that's pretty special too. We like to use huge pieces, gently roasted for extra crunch.

All Eat Natural bars are made with love and care from simple ingredients, in small batches at our own Makery. We never use artificial flavours, colours or preservatives. Here at Eat Natural, when we say 'natural', what exactly do we mean? Well, clearly it would be wrong of us to claim that everything in this bar is '100% natural' and simply 'grows on trees'. Obviously, some ingredients need to be cleaned, dried and roasted too, and therefore, to some extent, 'processed'. It's just that we believe, the less we mess with it.. the better it tastes.

"PowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Cookie Dough, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)",39.98,($1.67 /  count),NaN,"The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

They're dried naturally in the sun, giving them their rich, dark colour and authentic caramel sweetness. Cranberries A cranberry is not just for Christmas you know? These beautiful little bouncing balls, bursting with goodness, are perfect all year round. Slightly sweetened to make them less sharp and acidic, these normally festive friends are filled with fruitiness. All Eat Natural bars are made with love and care from simple ingredients, in small batches at our own Makery. We never use artificial flavours, colours or preservatives. Here at Eat Natural, when we say 'natural', what exactly do we mean? Well, clearly it would be wrong of us to claim that everything in this bar is '100% natural' and simply 'grows on trees'. Obviously, some ingredients need to be cleaned, dried and roasted too, and therefore, to some extent, 'processed'. It's just that we believe, the less we mess with it.. the better it tastes. That's why we never add any artificial flavours or colours, or any preservatives. Find us on Facebook Twitter@EatNaturalBars  "

	Having my dear son is what inspired Rani's Yummy® Granola.  Entering this new phase of being a mother, I needed a quick snack that provided nourishment and energy for my busy day.  In pursuing a degree in dietetics, I came to understand how food can have a large effect on our body functions and overall health.  With this knowledge I saw the importance of eating healthy for both my son and I.  It was shortly after, that I began experimenting with different recipes that consisted of our macro nutrients, protein, fat and carbohydrates.  In wanting to have all variations of those three nutrients, I started with using 100 % natural ingredients, consisting of oats for the protein, butter for the fat, and sugar, agave, maple syrup, and fruit as my sweeteners and carbohydrates. I wanted something nutritious and yummy.
I saw oats very differently than most.  To me, it was like working with a cake mix, ""very neutral"".  Meaning, whatever flavor is added to the oats it will take on that flavor.  At that point I began thinking of deserts, candy, popular junk cereal that I knew one day my son would desire and therefore I mimicked those with a healthy twist.  This granola is 100% natural with 100% usable energy. 
With a variety of different flavors, the yummy line was created for not just adults but for children alike. Amazingly Rani's Yummy appeals to people who are not generally fond of granola!  "

A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.       Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package.

Finally the high levels of synthetic vitamins and minerals on these products attest to the former claim as they are frequently added to the final product in an attempt to modify its nutritional facts, and receive a positive review regarding its benefits for consumers. Ingredients (organic certified): Whole oats, organic oat bran, organic raisins 10%, organic winter wheat, organic brown rice syrup, whole wheat flour, flours from organic grains: Rye, amaranth and quinoa, organic wheat bran, organic wheat germ, organic cane syrup, organic sesame seeds, organic coconut, brown rice oil, organic sesame oil, organic barley malt, sodium bicarbonate, organic cinnamon, organic vanilla, pure spring water.

"Rani's Yummy® Granola Key Lime, 1.2oz Loose Granola (Pack of 8) (Lime)",,NaN,5.8 x 2.5 x 7.5 inches ; 9.6 ounces,"About the Brand

Having my dear son is what inspired Rani's Yummy® Granola.  Entering this new phase of being a mother, I needed a quick snack that provided nourishment and energy for my busy day.  In pursuing a degree in dietetics, I came to understand how food can have a large effect on our body functions and over all health.  With this knowledge I saw the importance of eating healthy for both my son and I.  It was shortly after, that I began experimenting with different recipes that consisted of our macronutrients, protein, fat and carbohydrates.  In wanting to have all variations of those three nutrients, I started with using 100 % natural ingredients, consisting of oats for the protein, butter for the fat, and sugar, agave, maple syrup, and fruit as my sweeteners and carbohydrates. I wanted something nutritious and yummy.

I saw oats very differently than most.  To me, it was like working with a cake mix, ""very neutral"".  Meaning, whatever flavor is added to the oats it will take on that flavor.  At that point I began thinking of deserts, candy, popular junk cereal that I knew one day my son would desire and therefore I mimicked those with a healthy twist.  This granola is 100% natural with 100% useable energy. 

With a variety of different flavors, the yummy line was created for not just adults but for children alike. Amazingly Rani's Yummy appeals to people who are not generally fond of granola!

A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.

How should I use the PowerBar ProteinPlus Bar 30g? PowerBar ProteinPlus Bar 30g is designed for use before and/or after high-intensity training to support muscle growth and recovery, and they’re also a convenient source of high quality protein to add to your overall diet and training regimen.

Why is consuming protein and carbohydrates important after exercise? Consuming protein and carbohydrates during the recovery period is generally recommended to help build and repair muscle tissue.

The PowerBar TriSource protein blend is a combination of three protein sources: soy protein isolate, calcium caseinate, and whey protein isolate. Some of the protein in this bar comes from gelatin.

In May 2000, LÄRABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each invidual package by hand-- all 500 of them! Although LÄRABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.

Some people cannot tolerate gluten when it comes in contact with the small intestine. This condition is known as celiac disease. There is also evidence that a skin disorder called dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with gluten intolerance.In patients with celiac disease, gluten injures the lining of the small intestine. This injury results in weight loss, bloating, diarrhea, gas, abdominal cramps, or vitamin and mineral deficiencies. When patients totally eliminate gluten from the diet, the lining of the intestine has a chance to heal. In patients with gluten intolerance or gluten allergy, the symptoms are varied and also respond well to the reduction, severe limiting or removal of gluten from the diet.Removing gluten from the diet is not easy.

"PowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Wild Berry, 2.29-Ounce Bars , 12 Count, (Pack of 2)",38.49,($1.61 /  bar),NaN,"The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

Be sure, you will not have to lower your expectations even if you are eating a gluten-free, wheat-free snack bar. You do not have to settle for ordinary or tasteless gluten-free bars when Nature’s Path offers so much more--a pinch of this, a dash of that, but never anything artificial. This product contains no artificial additives, preservatives, or colors. Moreover, the USDA organic certification on this product means that the ingredients are grown without synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and nasty chemicals.  It is a sacrifice-free way of enjoying a healthy delicious snack. Whole Grain Goodness for Everyone The specialty of Nature’s Path is, and has always been, everything “whole grain”. If you decide to go “gluten free” then there is no healthier option than organic gluten free--products that are not only gluten free but also free of other things that can compromise health. Add to that, Non-GMO Project verified for an extra assurance when it comes to food safety. Nature’s Path uses gluten-free grains such as buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum, amaranth, brown rice, flax, teff, and whole grain corn . Amaranth: Long considered a native crop in Peru, amaranth was a major food crop of the ancient Aztecs and played a part in their religious practices as well. Amaranth is gluten free, high in protein, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It is the only grain that also contains vitamin C. Brown Rice: Naturally gluten free, whole-grain rice is usually brown but can also be black, purple, or even red. It is one of the most easily digested grains and though it is lower in fiber, it is still rich in many other nutrients. Buckwheat: It is not technically a grain at all and not any kind of wheat, but rather, a cousin of rhubarb! It is the only grain to have high levels of an antioxidant called rutin and of course, it is gluten free too. Certified gluten free and wheat free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization, an independent service that supervises gluten-free food production according to a consistent, defined, science-based standard that is confirmed by field inspections. Nature’s Path was the first USDA Certified producer of organic breakfast cereal in North America and we're the larges manufacturer of organic cereals to this day. Many of our gluten-free products are Non-GMO Project verified. GMO crops are found in so many of the foods implicated in health and digestive issues and have yet to be proven safe. We keep them out of our foods because we don’t believe in using people as guinea pigs in a lab experiment. Quality Assurance International is a third party certification organization that regularly inspects to ensure stringent organic food standards are met. All Nature’s Path foods are Kosher.  Whole Grain Corn: While it’s true that corn may be familiar, don’t overlook it when it comes to antioxidants. Corn has the highest levels of antioxidants of any grain or vegetable! Quinoa: It is another “grain” that is not quite a grain. Quinoa is actually a relative of Swiss chard and beets. This gluten free grain was a favorite of the Incas. It comes from South America and is a small, light colored grain that looks a bit like sesame seeds. It is a complete protein, delivering all the essential amino acids our bodies need. Sorghum: This hearty gluten free grain from Africa thrives where other grains would wither and die. It can be eaten like popcorn, cooked into porridge, or made into flour. It is very popular with people who have gluten issues. Teff: This is a tiny grain that comes from Africa--it is 1/150th the size of a wheat kernel. The fact that “teff” comes from the word “teffa” meaning “lost” starts to make sense. Teff has a sweet, molasses-like taste and can be used for baked goods, porridge, or ""teff polenta"". It is high in iron and calcium. About Nature’s Path For over 25 years, Nature’s Path has been mastering the art of whole grain baking with cereals, snacks, and waffles that are loaded with whole grain nutrition and wholesome goodness. They bake cereals with basic gluten containing grains used in typical manufacturing such as barley, rye, and oats. Out of the 128 innovative products that Nature’s Path makes twenty percent are certified gluten free--and many of these products are also whole grain. Organic is Healthier Organic makes much less impact on the Earth as no synthetic pesticides fertilizers or antibiotics are used and no chemicals are added to the food afterwards. It means less pollution in your world and in your bowl. Organic goes further towards giving you what nature intended--clean, pure, and real food. Nature’s Path has made America’s favorite gluten-free cereals for longer than anyone else has. Nobody offers a wider range of gluten free breakfast options--they know what makes a great tasting breakfast. You can make Nature’s Path your daily breakfast partner today!

Founded on the ideal of serving delicious, wholesome foods grown and processed in harmony with nature, the store soon expanded into milling, baking, making muesli, granolas, alfalfa sprouts, nut butters, energy bars, and wholesale distribution. Within a few years, the LifeStream line had grown to include a wide range of products, including both natural and organic whole grain foods and soy-based vegetarian entrees. The company even published its own vegetarian cookbook, which sold over 125,000 copies. Annual sales at LifeStream reached $9 million, making the line one of Canada?s leading natural food brands at the time. LifeStream sales continued to grow to $12 million, but an awkward partnership led to the sale of the company in 1981. It eventually was acquired by Kraft/Phillip Morris. Then in 1985, Arran and his wife, Ratana, started a new venture christened Nature?s Path, from the back of their natural foods restaurant. The company?s first product, Sprouted Organic Manna Bread, debuted at the Natural Products Expo in Anaheim, Calif. Organic Multigrain, Multigrain & Raisin, and Millet Rice Flakes were the very first Nature?s Path cereals and remain as popular as ever. By 1989, building on the success of its cereals, the company had grown 800%. To meet demand, acreage was bought and a 54,000 square foot organic processing plant was built in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. This was the first third-party certified organic cereal plant in the world. Later, ten years after starting Nature's Path, the Stephens family purchased back LifeStream from Kraft. Since, the company has continue to expand its facilities and the brands and products it offers--adding waffles, additional cereals, granola and energy bars, flaxseed meal, baking mixes, and more.   Real, organic hemps seeds, sunflower seeds and raisins; all made with good stuff like whole grain oats. Packed with raisins, sunflower seeds and nutritious hemp seeds! This bar has flaxseeds and is an excellent source of Omega 3’s. This could become a cult classic. And… All our bars now come in the EnviroBox, which is 36% smaller box than a standard 6.2 ounce box.

Viktorias Gourmet Foods Vikis Granola Original Honey -- 12 oz,5.12,NaN,NaN,"Simply the best tasting good for you granola Whole Grain Kosher High Energy Thanks for checking out my granola, which if you're reading this, is now yours as well. The granola you're about to enjoy started out as a homemade snack I made for friends and family. I've always been big into cooking and baking, but it never occurred to me to turn the passion into a business. One day I volunteered to bake some of my treats for a school fundraiser and my signature ""original honey"" granola turned out to be such a hit, it sold out in minutes. People I'd never met before wanted to know where they could buy more, or if I could whip up another batch for their friends and family. Next thing I knew, a business was born and soon I was making and marketing my special blend of sodium and cholesterol free granola in speciality shops all over New York and on the internet. From there... well somehow my make it up as we go distribution team found its way to you and the bag you now hold in your hands. There are no fillers, salts or preservatives. It's the kind of delicious, all natural snack you can feel good about sharing with the people you love, because it was originally made for the people I love. Try some on your favorite yogurt or ice cream, enjoy it as a bowl of cereal with milk, or (my favorite) share it with your friends straight out of the bag.Crunch responsibly, Viki  "

"PowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Banana, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)",38.66,($1.61 /  Item),NaN,"The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

"Powerbar Harvest Bars - Box 15 Bars Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, Box (15 Bars) - Men's",29.08,($0.61 /  oz),11 x 6 x 2 inches ; 2.4 pounds,"The PowerBar Harvest Bars taste better than the dry, cardboard substance you've gagged yourself with the last three training rides. In fact, the Powerbar Harvest Bars are so good that you may become addicted to them. It's true, although you could feasibly survive off the Harvest Bars alone (and some water to wash them down), we don't recommend it. We do however recommend that you take along a bar on your next training ride. Because after all, just because you took the afternoon off to go ride, doesn't mean your taste buds didn't come along. So how do the Harvest Bars provide energy? Easy. The Harvest Bars use a balanced mix of whole grains, soy protein, and natural fiber to keep you fueled for your ride. PowerBar claims that between 70 and 75 percent of the bars' energy is derived from carbohydrates. And as you've probably heard, carbs act like the gasoline for your body's engine. Where the Harvest Bar differs from the competition is in its aforementioned formula. The whole oats, fiber, and protein take longer to digest than glucose based carbohydrates, and this means that you receive a long, steady supply of carbs released into your bloodstream. This equates to consumable energy that simply lasts longer. The PowerBar Harvest Bars couldn't be easier to use for fuel on your next ride. Simply eat a bar 30 to 60 minutes before your ride, and then eat one every hour of your activity afterwards. No powders and no lab experiment goo food; just good, wholesome food. The PowerBar Harvest Bars are offered in a container of 15 individual bars and in the flavors Double Chocolate Crisp, Oatmeal Raisin Cookie, Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, and Toffee Chocolate Chip.

*More fiber than bran muffins,
*More Omega-3 and Omega-6 than salmon and 
*More protein than flax seed

This health-packed cereal is incredibly delicious. In fact, when the company was just starting out one of their very first customers said, ""Holy Crap... this is amazing!""

That's where the name ""Holy Crap"" comes from.

What makes Holy Crap cereal a better choice over other gluten-free breakfast cereals?

Erika Weissenborn, B.Sc. Food, Nutrition and Health for Holy Crap Cereal answers:

Most of the gluten-free cereals on the market today are made with refined corn, rice or other flours and refined sugars.

Food products that are refined cause sugar imbalances in the body.

Holy Crap uses ingredients that are naturally gluten-free, sugar-free, nutrient dense and delicious.

If you are looking to not only cut out gluten, but make positive changes to your diet then Holy Crap cereal is ideal for you.

Start your day on the right track and enjoy.  "

Fill Up on Fiber The studies are clear--fiber can help promote weight loss and healthier eating patterns, while increasing overall health: Fiber takes longer to chew and slows down the rate at which we eat--giving our bodies a chance to let us know when we are full. With fewer calories and greater bulk, high-fiber foods help us feel fuller for longer. Fiber helps keep the digestive tract clean and healthy decreasing risk of intestinal disease. Fiber-rich diets can help lower 'bad' cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and help control blood sugar levels.    Snacks Matter Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children and adults with needed energy to keep brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size.

A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.       Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.

A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.      Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.

In 60 A.C., the Greek government banned the fig from being exported. Why Because a rather smart fellow named Plato realized that the fig was good fuel for athletes. In an effort to gain a competitive advantage at the Olympic Games, Greece made every attempt to keep the figs all to themselves
Today, figs are known as one of the highest plant sources of calcium and fiber. They are also rich in copper, manganese, magnesium, potassium, calcium, vitamin K and antioxidants
Blueberry
According to legend, the blueberry was the real star of the first Thanksgiving, as Native Americans shared dried blueberries with the pilgrims to help them through their first winter.
Native Americans used these star berries, as they called them, for soups, stews, meats and medicinal purposes. They also made one of the first blueberry baked goods, called Sautauthig, out of blueberries, cracked corn and water
Blueberries are chock-full of vitamin C, fiber, manganese and antioxidants.
Raspberry
While wild raspberries can be traced back to eastern Asia during prehistoric times, with certain varieties also found in the Western Hemisphere, historians believe no one thought to cultivate their deliciousness until the 16th century. Thanks to human travelers and their animal counterparts, the seeds were carried and spread both intentionally and accidentally, worldwide.
Raspberries are an excellent source of fiber, manganese and vitamin C, among other health benefits.  "

It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise. What's in the Box PowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Milk Chocolate Brownie (Pack of 24). Performance Energy Bars Trademark Information: PowerBar® Performance Energy Bar     The original energy bar. Sustained energy for a performance edge. PowerBar Performance, the Original Energy Bar, is a trusted source of fuel for athletes of all levels.

A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 130-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go.

Be sure, you will not have to lower your expectations even if you are eating a gluten-free, wheat-free snack bar. You do not have to settle for ordinary or tasteless gluten-free bars when Nature’s Path offers so much more--a pinch of this, a dash of that, but never anything artificial. This product contains no artificial additives, preservatives, or colors. Moreover, the USDA organic certification on this product means that the ingredients are grown without synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and nasty chemicals. It is a sacrifice-free way of enjoying a healthy delicious snack. Whole Grain Goodness for Everyone The specialty of Nature’s Path is, and has always been, everything “whole grain”. If you decide to go “gluten free” then there is no healthier option than organic gluten free--products that are not only gluten free but also free of other things that can compromise health. Add to that, Non-GMO Project verified for an extra assurance when it comes to food safety. Nature’s Path uses gluten-free grains such as buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum, amaranth, brown rice, flax, teff, and whole grain corn . Amaranth: Long considered a native crop in Peru, amaranth was a major food crop of the ancient Aztecs and played a part in their religious practices as well. Amaranth is gluten free, high in protein, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It is the only grain that also contains vitamin C. Brown Rice: Naturally gluten free, whole-grain rice is usually brown but can also be black, purple, or even red. It is one of the most easily digested grains and though it is lower in fiber, it is still rich in many other nutrients. Buckwheat: It is not technically a grain at all and not any kind of wheat, but rather, a cousin of rhubarb! It is the only grain to have high levels of an antioxidant called rutin and of course, it is gluten free too. Certified gluten free and wheat free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization, an independent service that supervises gluten-free food production according to a consistent, defined, science-based standard that is confirmed by field inspections. Nature’s Path was the first USDA Certified producer of organic breakfast cereal in North America and we're the larges manufacturer of organic cereals to this day. Many of our gluten-free products are Non-GMO Project verified. GMO crops are found in so many of the foods implicated in health and digestive issues and have yet to be proven safe. We keep them out of our foods because we don’t believe in using people as guinea pigs in a lab experiment. Quality Assurance International is a third party certification organization that regularly inspects to ensure stringent organic food standards are met. All Nature’s Path foods are Kosher.  Whole Grain Corn: While it’s true that corn may be familiar, don’t overlook it when it comes to antioxidants. Corn has the highest levels of antioxidants of any grain or vegetable! Quinoa: It is another “grain” that is not quite a grain. Quinoa is actually a relative of Swiss chard and beets. This gluten free grain was a favorite of the Incas. It comes from South America and is a small, light colored grain that looks a bit like sesame seeds. It is a complete protein, delivering all the essential amino acids our bodies need. Sorghum: This hearty gluten free grain from Africa thrives where other grains would wither and die. It can be eaten like popcorn, cooked into porridge, or made into flour. It is very popular with people who have gluten issues. Teff: This is a tiny grain that comes from Africa--it is 1/150th the size of a wheat kernel. The fact that “teff” comes from the word “teffa” meaning “lost” starts to make sense. Teff has a sweet, molasses-like taste and can be used for baked goods, porridge, or ""teff polenta"". It is high in iron and calcium. About Nature’s Path For over 25 years, Nature’s Path has been mastering the art of whole grain baking with cereals, snacks, and waffles that are loaded with whole grain nutrition and wholesome goodness. They bake cereals with basic gluten containing grains used in typical manufacturing such as barley, rye, and oats. Out of the 128 innovative products that Nature’s Path makes twenty percent are certified gluten free--and many of these products are also whole grain. Organic is Healthier Organic makes much less impact on the Earth as no synthetic pesticides fertilizers or antibiotics are used and no chemicals are added to the food afterwards. It means less pollution in your world and in your bowl. Organic goes further towards giving you what nature intended--clean, pure, and real food. Nature’s Path has made America’s favorite gluten-free cereals for longer than anyone else has. Nobody offers a wider range of gluten free breakfast options--they know what makes a great tasting breakfast. You can make Nature’s Path your daily breakfast partner today! What is in the box This is sold in a pack of six 6-count bars (total 36 bars).    Low fat! Low sodium! Nothing artificial! Gluten free. What's good about certified organic goodness?

It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

In May 2000, LÄRABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each invidual package by hand-- all 500 of them! Although LÄRABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.

With 35% of your daily fiber needs, 7 grams of whole grains, plus antioxidants vitamin E and zinc, Kellogg's FiberPlus Chocolatey Peanut Butter Bars  fuel your day nutritiously.  Fill Up on Fiber The studies are clear--fiber can help promote weight loss and healthier eating patterns, while increasing overall health: Fiber takes longer to chew and slows down the rate at which we eat--giving our bodies a chance to let us know when we are full. With fewer calories and greater bulk, high-fiber foods help us feel fuller for longer. Fiber helps keep the digestive tract clean and healthy decreasing risk of intestinal disease. Fiber-rich diets can help lower 'bad' cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and help control blood sugar levels.    Snacks Matter Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children and adults with needed energy to keep brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped FiberPlus Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Special K Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go.

    Heart health. Heart-healthy diets rich in whole grain foods can reduce the risk of heart disease.

    Reduce cancer risk. Low fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, particularly of the stomach and colon.

    Manage diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends whole grain as part of a diabetic diet.

    Keep you regular. Fiber from whole grains promotes regularity and keeps the intestines working smoothly to help maintain good digestive health.

    Weight management. A growing body of evidence supports that people who eat more whole grain tend to have healthier body weights and gain less weight over time than those who don't.

If you don't, you're probably not getting all the nutrients you need.

I know consuming five or more servings is a challenge for the majority of individuals.

After many years of research and development, my team and I have come up with what I consider a ""green food solution"" for helping to increase your daily nutrient intake when you can't get all of the vegetables and green leafy foods that are recommended.

My Organic Greens is a high-quality formula that is:

    Quick and easy to use
    Easily taken with shakes, smoothies, and protein powder drinks
    Sweetened naturally with organic stevia extract

Plus, it doesn't have a strong, unpleasant ""green"" taste even though it's packed with:

    Powdered forms of an assortment of organic vegetables plus organic cereal grasses from North America
    Two of my top superfoods - Chlorella and Spirulina
    An organic Mushroom Blend for immune support*
    Exceptional alkalizing extracts that provide antioxidant benefits, including one of Japan's best kept secrets - Green Matcha - Apple and Green Tea*
    Two of my favorite adaptogen ingredients - Maca Root and Rhodiola

My Organic Greens has been tested to ensure it's non-GMO and gluten-free.

Perhaps you've tried other green food supplements, only to find them to be disappointing in taste and texture.

I invite you to try my Organic Greens for an entirely new green food experience. I know you'll be pleasantly surprised when you discover its light, green tea taste.  "

	Having my dear son is what inspired Rani's Yummy® Granola.  Entering this new phase of being a mother, I needed a quick snack that provided nourishment and energy for my busy day.  In pursuing a degree in dietetics, I came to understand how food can have a large effect on our body functions and overall health.  With this knowledge I saw the importance of eating healthy for both my son and I.  It was shortly after, that I began experimenting with different recipes that consisted of our macro nutrients, protein, fat and carbohydrates.  In wanting to have all variations of those three nutrients, I started with using 100 % natural ingredients, consisting of oats for the protein, butter for the fat, and sugar, agave, maple syrup, and fruit as my sweeteners and carbohydrates. I wanted something nutritious and yummy.
I saw oats very differently than most.  To me, it was like working with a cake mix, ""very neutral"".  Meaning, whatever flavor is added to the oats it will take on that flavor.  At that point I began thinking of deserts, candy, popular junk cereal that I knew one day my son would desire and therefore I mimicked those with a healthy twist.  This granola is 100% natural with 100% usable energy. 
With a variety of different flavors, the yummy line was created for not just adults but for children alike. Amazingly Rani's Yummy appeals to people who are not generally fond of granola!  "

In May 2000, LÄRABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each invidual package by hand-- all 500 of them! Although LÄRABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.

At Larabar(R), we delight in creating delicious flavors from just a few carefully chosen ingredients. So, when we set out to make a sweet and salty bar with added crunch, we knew it had to have big pieces of nuts and fruits and big taste. It was a simple idea, but the result was nothing short of magic. We're excited to present Uber(TM), the ultimate in Simple. Pure. Delicious.(R)  "

"Powerbar Performance Bars - 12 Pack Apple-Cinnamon, 12 Bars - Men's",,($0.52 /  oz),6 x 9 x 2 inches ; 1.7 pounds,"During the nineties energy bars gained quick acceptance over homemade and grocery-store alternatives due to their pack-ability, nutritional value, and long shelf life. In a word, convenient. At the forefront of that energy-bar movement was Powerbar and its line of Performance Bars. While most of those energy-bar start ups have quietly disappeared, Powerbar, like one of its sponsored endurance athletes, has soldiered on. This is because Powerbar has continually fine tuned its flavors and formula to ease digestion while providing nutritional benefits for high-intensity athletes. Fore example, each low-fat bar contains 200mg of sodium-based electrolytes to help the body efficiently replenish its water supply. This helps prevent dehydration when exercising or competing in extreme conditions. But, that's just one advantage these energy-bars bring to serious endurance athletes. Through extensive research and development, Powerbar's optimized a glucose to fructose blend with a two-to-one ratio for efficient and long-lasting energy. What they've coined C2MAX, this dual-source energy blend helps supply more energy to muscles than glucose alone. In fact, testing by Med Sci Sports Exerc journal as shown this ratio to deliver 20 - 50 percent more energy to muscles, and improve endurance performance by eight percent.

By  MichelleinMO   on January 16, 2008  By far my favorite of them all! This has a nice texture and tastes so so good, and it's a decent sized bar and fills me up every time! You cannot go wrong with this kind. If you like peanut butter you will like this bar!   Comment     Was this review helpful to you?   Yes No    Sending feedback...  Thank you for your feedback.

By  Andrew Dunning   on March 12, 2007  These are probably some of the best bars I ever had when it comes to taste...and they do not have sugar. Careful on the chocolate ones...they have a funky chocolate after taste...but these peanut butter ones are great   Comment     Was this review helpful to you?   Yes No    Sending feedback...

It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

Made with a soft, golden baked crust of wheat and whole grain oats and filled with real raspberry puree, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer flavor everyone will love. Not only do Raspberry Nutri-Grain Bars taste great--they are packed nine essential vitamins, eight grams of whole grains, three grams of dietary fiber, and two grams of protein--in each bar. Whether you start your day with a Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar, add it to your child's lunch box as sweet nutritious treat, or enjoy it as a mid-day snack, Raspberry Nutri-Grain Bars offer more of what your body needs to live well and help you eat better all day.  A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.       Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.

Dear eat naturalists...

Down here at the Eat Natural Makery, we like to think, we go that little bit further to make you happy. We don't mean that in a smug, 'aren't we cleaver' type that way...it's just that, when you're happy, you tend to let us know... and that's the best feeling there is.

That's why we make your bars pretty much by hand, with loads of love and care chucked in, and why we make sure we search out ingredients, that not only taste the best, but are grown by people who care as much as we do.

And hold on a mo...

What about those ingredients? Let's not wash over them. There's some pretty tasty bits and bobs crammed into that reassuringly tiny list. Some big old nuts, and a whole load of huge, juicy sultanas and apricots and a healthy dollop of honey. Pretty straightforward maybe...but also pretty special, if you ask me.

Simple... isn't it?

Down here at the Eat Natural Makery, when we say 'natural', what exactly do we mean? Well, clearly it would be wrong of us to claim that everything in this bar is '100% natural' yoghurt coating, glucose and crisped rice simply don't grow on trees. Obviously, everything needs to be cleaned, dried and roasted too, and therefore, to some extent, 'processed'. It's just that we believe, the less we mess with it...the better it tastes, and why we will never, ever add any dodgy stuff. That means, no artificial flavours or colours and no preservatives.

"Thunderbird Energetica Bars Cacao Hemp Walnut, 15 Pack - Men's",34.99,($1.66 /  oz),NaN,"Before Thunderbird Energetica existed, one of its founders, Katie, had a problem to solve: she was training for the Ironman World Championships with a severely sore and inflamed knee, and she found that the artificial ingredients in so many available nutritional products only made it worse. She and her husband experimented with various ingredients to make their own bars with entirely natural ingredients that didn't provoke her injury, and the result turned into Thunderbird Energetica Bars. The rest, as they say, is history. So what's the connection between a knee injury and organic ingredients? The body requires proper nutrition to heal, to train, and to recover, and the synthesized proteins and sugars in lots of the products out there not only impede the body's ability to heal itself, but can irritate it in the process. Thunderbird Energetica bars are made from nature's most nutrient-dense ingredients, and being that each ingredient is entirely raw (never heated above 115 degrees Fahrenheit), they retain all of the natural enzymes that are normally broken down when cooked. Your body can thoroughly utilize the entire bar, as opposed to the small percentage of the ingredients in many of the market's artificially-sourced bars. The bottom line: a small bar that packs a big punch. Thunderbird Energetica Bars are mostly fruit- and nut-based. They are sweeter in taste and have higher glycemic levels for a more immediate, less sustained boost of energy when compared to the company's line of Gather bars. Each bar comes in a 100%-compostable wrapper. All flavors are free of GMOs, agave, soy, gluten, and are vegan. Bars come in boxes of 15 and are available in six flavors: Sweet Lemon Rain Dance, Hyper Hawaiian Crunch, Cherry Walnut Crunch, Cashew Fig Carrot, Cacao Hemp Walnut, and Almond Cookie Pow-Wow.  "

Made with a soft, golden baked crust of wheat and whole grain oats and filled with real blueberry puree, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer flavor everyone will love. Not only do Blueberry Nutri-Grain Bars taste great--they are packed nine essential vitamins, eight grams of whole grains, three grams of dietary fiber, and two grams of protein--in each bar. Whether you start your day with a Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar, add it to your child's lunch box as sweet nutritious treat, or enjoy it as a mid-day snack, Blueberry Nutri-Grain Bars offer more of what your body needs to live well and help you eat better all day.  A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.      Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.

The LÄRABAR Story  Lara Merriken was hiking in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado when inspiration struck: create a new kind of nutrition bar using wholesome, natural ingredients. In May 2000, LÄRABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each individual package by hand — all 500 of them! Although LÄRABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.    Coconut Macaroon is also:   Gluten Free  Non-GMO  Kosher         Über - synonyms: super duper, wicked awesome, seriously epic. At LÄRABAR, we delight in creating delicious flavors from just a few carefully chosen ingredients. So, when we set out to make a sweet and salty bar with added crunch, we knew it had to have big pieces of nuts and fruits and big taste. It was a simple idea, but the result was nothing short of magic. We're excited to present über, the ultimate in SIMPLE. PURE. DELICIOUS.     "

As Nutrition Counselors, we simply wanted to find a good nutrition bar we could rec?ommend to our patients.  But despite our best efforts, there weren’t any on the market we really liked.  If a particular bar was nutritionally balanced, it left something to be desired in the taste department. If it tasted good, it was low in protein and fiber, or full of artificial ingredients, unhealthy fats and empty calories.  Then we came up with a deliciously different idea.  We could create our own all-natural nutrition bar. Our take on the perfect snack.  A bar with everything we wanted it to have, and nothing we didn’t.  A healthy balance of carbs, protein and beneficial fats, but no artificial sweeteners, colors or preservatives.  No trans fats, synthetic vitamins, or allergy-aggravating gluten, wheat or soy protein.  In short, a nutrition bar that everyone-including nutritionists and other healthcare professionals-could love.

Be sure, you will not have to lower your expectations even if you are eating a gluten-free, wheat-free snack bar. You do not have to settle for ordinary or tasteless gluten-free bars when Nature’s Path offers so much more--a pinch of this, a dash of that, but never anything artificial. This product contains no artificial additives, preservatives, or colors. Moreover, the USDA organic certification on this product means that the ingredients are grown without synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and nasty chemicals.  It is a sacrifice-free way of enjoying a healthy delicious snack. Whole Grain Goodness for Everyone The specialty of Nature’s Path is, and has always been, everything “whole grain”. If you decide to go “gluten free” then there is no healthier option than organic gluten free--products that are not only gluten free but also free of other things that can compromise health. Add to that, Non-GMO Project verified for an extra assurance when it comes to food safety. Nature’s Path uses gluten-free grains such as buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum, amaranth, brown rice, flax, teff, and whole grain corn . Amaranth: Long considered a native crop in Peru, amaranth was a major food crop of the ancient Aztecs and played a part in their religious practices as well. Amaranth is gluten free, high in protein, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It is the only grain that also contains vitamin C. Brown Rice: Naturally gluten free, whole-grain rice is usually brown but can also be black, purple, or even red. It is one of the most easily digested grains and though it is lower in fiber, it is still rich in many other nutrients. Buckwheat: It is not technically a grain at all and not any kind of wheat, but rather, a cousin of rhubarb! It is the only grain to have high levels of an antioxidant called rutin and of course, it is gluten free too. Certified gluten free and wheat free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization, an independent service that supervises gluten-free food production according to a consistent, defined, science-based standard that is confirmed by field inspections. Nature’s Path was the first USDA Certified producer of organic breakfast cereal in North America and we're the larges manufacturer of organic cereals to this day. Many of our gluten-free products are Non-GMO Project verified. GMO crops are found in so many of the foods implicated in health and digestive issues and have yet to be proven safe. We keep them out of our foods because we don’t believe in using people as guinea pigs in a lab experiment. Quality Assurance International is a third party certification organization that regularly inspects to ensure stringent organic food standards are met. All Nature’s Path foods are Kosher.  Whole Grain Corn: While it’s true that corn may be familiar, don’t overlook it when it comes to antioxidants. Corn has the highest levels of antioxidants of any grain or vegetable! Quinoa: It is another “grain” that is not quite a grain. Quinoa is actually a relative of Swiss chard and beets. This gluten free grain was a favorite of the Incas. It comes from South America and is a small, light colored grain that looks a bit like sesame seeds. It is a complete protein, delivering all the essential amino acids our bodies need. Sorghum: This hearty gluten free grain from Africa thrives where other grains would wither and die. It can be eaten like popcorn, cooked into porridge, or made into flour. It is very popular with people who have gluten issues. Teff: This is a tiny grain that comes from Africa--it is 1/150th the size of a wheat kernel. The fact that “teff” comes from the word “teffa” meaning “lost” starts to make sense. Teff has a sweet, molasses-like taste and can be used for baked goods, porridge, or ""teff polenta"". It is high in iron and calcium. About Nature’s Path For over 25 years, Nature’s Path has been mastering the art of whole grain baking with cereals, snacks, and waffles that are loaded with whole grain nutrition and wholesome goodness. They bake cereals with basic gluten containing grains used in typical manufacturing such as barley, rye, and oats. Out of the 128 innovative products that Nature’s Path makes twenty percent are certified gluten free--and many of these products are also whole grain. Organic is Healthier Organic makes much less impact on the Earth as no synthetic pesticides fertilizers or antibiotics are used and no chemicals are added to the food afterwards. It means less pollution in your world and in your bowl. Organic goes further towards giving you what nature intended--clean, pure, and real food. Nature’s Path has made America’s favorite gluten-free cereals for longer than anyone else has. Nobody offers a wider range of gluten free breakfast options--they know what makes a great tasting breakfast. You can make Nature’s Path your daily breakfast partner today!

"Honey Stinger Stinger Waffle - 16 Pack Strawberry, One Size - Men's",22.25,($1.03 /  oz),7 x 4 x 3 inches ; 1 ounces,"If you've ridden the roads of Belgium, Honey Stinger's Organic Stinger Waffles might remind you of the waffles you'd have inevitably snacked on. But aside from the waffle pattern and round shape, the differences are perhaps greater than the similarities. Honey Stinger's Waffles are created just for endurance athletes, not merely as a tasty morning snack. And that they're packaged in single serving units makes them easy to carry in your jersey pocket for that moment when you'd like to eat something with a bit of texture. The Stinger Waffles are simultaneously toasty and chewy as you eat them. And unlike bizarre lab-born products, the natural ingredients in the Waffles chew easily and go down quick -- almost too quick. Because they taste so good, you'd like for them to last a bit longer. Like their other energy foods, the Honey Stinger Waffles rely on honey, nature's energy food, for a majority of the carbohydrate load. The honey is easily digested because it's made of a just-right 1:1 blend of fructose and glucose. It acts quickly to give you a burst of energy and is easy on the stomach. With the waffle, you'll also get carbs from organic wheat and soy flour along with organic cane sugar and rice syrup. Honey Stinger Organic Stinger Waffles are packaged in a box of 16 individually wrapped waffles. They come in Honey, Vanilla, Chocolate, Lemon, and Strawberry flavors and are a great on and off the bike snack. Comes as a box of 16 individually wrapped wafflesEach 30g waffle contains 160 caloriesThe sweet and chewy waffle doesn't taste like an 'energy bar,' and you may catch yourself eating them at homeNot safe for cyclists or runners with allergies to wheat, soy, or eggs  "
"PowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Vanilla Crisp, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)",38.49,($1.61 /  bar),NaN,"The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been clinically proven to outperform glucose alone. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

"LARABAR Jocalat, Chocolate, Gluten Free (Pack of 16)",22.49,($1.41 /  count),8.2 x 5 x 2.5 inches ; 1.7 pounds,"It started out as just a hike, no different than countless others I've taken into the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Little did I know I was about to come up with a mountain of an idea: Combine wholesome ingredients such as fruits and nuts to create a food product that's tasty, healthy and convenient. In that instant, in May 2000, LÄRABAR was born. After scouring the aisles of grocery stores and noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, I delved into my own product development. Natural foods, I believed, should be fun and enjoyable as well as good for you. With friends and family serving as focus groups, I tinkered with recipes until a consensus on yummi-ness was reached. The next step was to launch a company to market what would initially be five delicious LÄRABAR flavors: Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. I also assembled a sophisticated manufacturing arm...what amounted to be a Cuisinart and a rolling pin. The first batch of bars I produced for retail had to be sealed by hand - all 500 of them! Thank goodness we have machines for that job today. After all, we're producing millions of LÄRABAR's every year. They are a healthy indulgence you can feel good about eating. And ""feeling good"" is what it's all about. Believe it or not, I used to be a junk food junkie - until I discovered how natural foods enlivened my mind, body and spirit. A passion for healthy living soon followed, and continues to be a driving force behind everything I do professionally and personally. I really appreciate the opportunity I have to make a positive difference in the world we live in. Health is indeed your greatest wealth. Lara, CEO/ Founder                Simple. Pure. Delicious.  At LÄRABAR, we believe that the foundation of a sound mind, body, and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is most delicious and satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state.  LÄRABAR Jöcalat is an organic chocolate food bar made from fruits, nuts, and Fair Trade Certified chocolate. Each flavor contains no more than six simple, organic ingredients that are deliciously rich, without added sugars and free of dairy, soy, and gluten.  Chocolate  Nourish your cocoa-loving soul with the richness of organic chocolate. Blended with dates and nuts, this delightful treat provides a quarter cup of fruit, 5 grams of fiber and 15% of the recommended daily value of Magnesium.  Chocolate is made with Organic Dates, Organic Almonds, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Powder, and Organic Walnuts.                         The LÄRABAR Story  Lara Merriken was hiking in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado when inspiration struck: create a new kind of nutrition bar using wholesome, natural ingredients. In May 2000, LÄRABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each individual package by hand — all 500 of them! Although LÄRABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.    Chocolate is also:   Gluten Free  Non-GMO  Kosher  Fair Trade Certified           Product Description  As indulgent as a fudge brownie. The richness comes from pure organic chocolate and luscious cashews - the satisfying crunch from almonds, walnuts, and whole cacao beans. Other benefits: 5 grams of natural fiber, more than 20% of the recommended daily value, as well as the almonds' 3 grams of Omega 6 essential fatty acids, and Vitamin E. Dates contribute to the 13 essential vitamins and minerals, and cashews are rich in iron, zinc and B Vitamins. Who knew a brownie could be so good for you?     "

What Are Whole Grains?  Do you know the difference between whole grains and refined grains? Many people do not.  Refined grains do not contain all parts of the grain. During the milling process, the bran and germ are removed, leaving only the endosperm. This results in refined grains, which contain less fiber and fewer vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytonutrients than whole grains. Whole grains have not had their bran and germ removed by the milling process, which makes them a richer source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals.  The Structure of a Whole Grain  Whole grains contain all three parts of the grain – the germ, endosperm and bran. The nutrients contained in whole grains work together to provide you with the maximum health benefits.  Bran: The bran consists of the coarse outer layers of the kernel. It contains the greatest amount of fiber and is a rich source of vitamins and nutrients. Endosperm: The endosperm is the largest section and the middle layer of the kernel. It is the main energy source of the plant. Germ: The germ is the embryo of the plant in its early stages. It is the heart of the grain and the smallest part of the kernel, but it is loaded with nutrients.  Tips for Adding Whole Grains to Your Diet  Whole grains are versatile and can be easily incorporated into a healthy lifestyle. A variety of whole grain foods are available at your grocery store. Here are a few simple ways you can add whole grains to your diet:  Substitute whole grain products, such as pasta or bread, for their refined counterparts. Choose whole grain, high fiber cereals for breakfast, such as oatmeal or shredded wheat. Try substituting whole wheat or oat flour for up to half the flour in flour-based recipes. Build your favorite sandwich on whole wheat bread or rolls instead of white bread. Add whole oats or crushed whole wheat crackers to your meatloaf recipe. Toast oats and grains to enhance their natural nutty flavor before using them as a crunchy topping for your salad or yogurt. Use rolled oats or crushed unsweetened whole grain cereal as breading for baked chicken or fish recipes. Add barley or wild rice in your favorite soup, stew and casserole recipes.     "

McCann’s has been making the classic oatmeal product for more than 150 years - and it has changed very little in that time--it is still the same real thing. McCann’s is best known for its classic steel cut oats packed in the iconic 28-ounce tin. However, there are many other tasty products available--quick cooking oatmeal, instant oatmeal, and oat bran.

"PowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Apple Cinnamon, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)",39.59,($1.66 /  bar),NaN,"The PowerBar Performance Energy Bar is a great choice for use before and during training sessions and high-intensity competitions like running, cycling, and swimming. It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

Milk chocolate The unique and exclusive recipe for our gorgeously smooth, melt-in-the-mouth milk chocolate, has been lovingly created to perfectly enhance the fabulous feast of fruits and nuts in this bar. Its sweet, velvet creaminess is simply heavenly. Peanuts Has there ever been a food quite as under-rated as the humble little peanut? We adore these lovable legumes - so much flavour and crunchiness in a perfect little package, with more protein than any type of nut. 'Willpower' they say, 'is the ability to eat just one'. Cranberries A cranberry is not just for Christmas you know? These beautiful little bouncing balls, bursting with goodness, are perfect all year round. Slightly sweetened to make them less sharp and acidic, these normally festive friends are filled with fruitiness. Cashews If you think they're just 'big posh peanuts' you couldn't be more wrong. Whilst peanuts are legumes that grow underground, cashew nuts are actually the shelled seeds of the exotic cashew apple - a tree-grown fruit and a delicacy in Goa, where ours originate. All Eat natural bars are made with love and care from simple ingredients, in small batches at our own Makery. We never use artificial flavours, colours or preservatives. Here at Eat Natural, when we say 'natural', what exactly do we mean? Well, clearly it would be wrong of us to claim that everything in this bar is '100% natural' and simply 'grows on trees'. Obviously, some ingredients need to be cleaned, dried and roasted too, and therefore, to some extent, 'processed'. It's just that we believe, the less we mess with it.. the better it tastes. That's why we never add any artificial flavours or colours, or any preservatives. Find us on Facebook Twitter@EatNaturalBars  "

"LARABAR Jocalat, Chocolate Mint, Gluten Free, 1.7oz  (Pack of 16)",22.49,($1.41 /  count),NaN,"It started out as just a hike, no different than countless others I've taken into the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Little did I know I was about to come up with a mountain of an idea: Combine wholesome ingredients such as fruits and nuts to create a food product that's tasty, healthy and convenient. In that instant, in May 2000, LÄRABAR was born. After scouring the aisles of grocery stores and noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, I delved into my own product development. Natural foods, I believed, should be fun and enjoyable as well as good for you. With friends and family serving as focus groups, I tinkered with recipes until a consensus on yummi-ness was reached. The next step was to launch a company to market what would initially be five delicious LÄRABAR flavors: Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. I also assembled a sophisticated manufacturing arm...what amounted to be a Cuisinart and a rolling pin. The first batch of bars I produced for retail had to be sealed by hand - all 500 of them! Thank goodness we have machines for that job today. After all, we're producing millions of LÄRABAR's every year. They are a healthy indulgence you can feel good about eating. And ""feeling good"" is what it's all about. Believe it or not, I used to be a junk food junkie - until I discovered how natural foods enlivened my mind, body and spirit. A passion for healthy living soon followed, and continues to be a driving force behind everything I do professionally and personally. I really appreciate the opportunity I have to make a positive difference in the world we live in. Health is indeed your greatest wealth. Lara, CEO/ Founder                Simple. Pure. Delicious.  At LÄRABAR, we believe that the foundation of a sound mind, body, and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is most delicious and satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state.  LÄRABAR Jöcalat is an organic chocolate food bar made from fruits, nuts, and Fair Trade Certified chocolate. Each flavor contains no more than six simple, organic ingredients that are deliciously rich, without added sugars and free of dairy, soy, and gluten.  Chocolate Mint  Delight in the taste of organic chocolate with a burst of cool peppermint. Just like the mint cookies of your childhood, plus the added benefit of a quarter cup of fruit, 5 grams of fiber and 15% of the recommended daily value of Magnesium.  Chocolate Mint is made with Organic Dates, Organic Almonds, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Powder, Organic Vanilla Flavor, and Organic Peppermint Flavor.                          The LÄRABAR Story  Lara Merriken was hiking in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado when inspiration struck: create a new kind of nutrition bar using wholesome, natural ingredients. In May 2000, LÄRABAR was born. Lara began the company with a simple vision of combining fruits and nuts into an enjoyable product that was as delicious as it was healthful. She scoured the aisles of grocery stores, noting popular flavors of ice cream and cookies, then recruited her friends and family as focus groups to test new recipes.  The first five flavors Lara launched were Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Cashew Cookie, Banana Cookie, and Chocolate Coconut Chew. She made the products herself and sealed each individual package by hand — all 500 of them! Although LÄRABARs are now manufactured outside of Lara's kitchen, they're every bit as wholesome and nutritious as they were when the company was founded. They're an indulgent nutrition bar you can truly feel good about eating.    Chocolate Mint is also:   Gluten Free  Non-GMO  Kosher  Fair Trade Certified           Product Description  Decadent like the mint cookies you grew up on. The indulgence begins with pure organic chocolate and a satisfying crunch of almonds and whole cacao beans, then finishes with a cool burst of peppermint, known to aid in digestion and detoxification. The nutritional numbers are also exciting. 6 grams of natural fiber, 22% of the recommended daily value, as well as the almonds' 1.5 grams of Omega 6 essential fatty acids and Vitamin E. Dates contribute to the 13 essential vitamins and minerals. Go ahead, eat two!     "

It's formulated with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend, a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20 to 50 percent more energy to muscles than glucose alone and improve endurance performance by 8 percent. Performance Energy Bars also contain 200 milligrams of sodium--a key electrolyte lost in sweat that is associated with muscle cramping in some athletes. Performance Energy Bar At a Glance: Provides more energy to muscles with C2MAX Contains 200 milligrams of sodium, a key electrolyte The original energy bar Low in fat, with 8 to 9 grams of protein per bar No preservatives or artificial flavors Contains 200 milligrams of sodium to replenish electrolytes and prevent fatigue. C2MAX formula provides your muscles with 20 to 50 percent more energy. Energy to Fuel Your Workout Fueling up right can make a big impact on how you feel and perform, no matter what you're tackling. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars are high in easily digestible carbs to top off your muscle glycogen stores before exercise. Each bar contains 3.5 to 5 grams of fat and small amounts of fiber. High-fat and high-fiber foods before exercise can slow down the gastric emptying rate, leaving you more susceptible to stomach discomfort during exercise. Choosing a sports nutrition product like PowerBar Performance Energy bars before and during exercise will give you the energy your muscles need for optimal performance and leave you less likely to experience stomach discomfort. Eat one bar 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and for events lasting more than 60 minutes, eat one to two bars per hour during exercise. How C2MAX Works Athletes and exercise enthusiasts need to eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates on a daily basis in order to load up on muscle fuel stores of glycogen before and after exercise. You also need carbs during exercise in order to delay the onset of fatigue. PowerBar Performance Energy Bars provide maximum energy delivery with PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Transportable carbohydrates--the combination of glucose and fructose found in C2MAX--have been research supported to outperform glucose alone. Through an ever-growing list of published studies, researchers have made a compelling case for transportable carbohydrates as the fuel of choice during endurance exercise. Benefits in comparison to glucose alone include increased delivery of carbohydrate fuel to working muscles; enhanced emptying of fluids from the gut and improved delivery of fluids to the bloodstream; better reliance on ingested carbs as fuel in difficult, high-temperature conditions; and increased endurance performance. This groundbreaking research on transportable carbohydrates is the basis for the muscle-fueling innovation known as PowerBar C2MAX dual-source energy blend. Seeing the incredible performance potential in this cutting-edge research, and, in fact, collaborating with the researchers pioneering this scientific work, PowerBar scientists have incorporated the research-supported 2:1 ratio of glucose and fructose into PowerBar sports nutrition product intended to fuel and hydrate athletes during higher intensity exercise.

Chocolate chips and gooey whole-grain goodness add great taste to Kellogg’s FiberPlus Chocolate Chip Snack bars. Great for any time of day, these bars offer fiber-rich nutrition in a sweet   package. With 35% of your daily fiber needs, 7 grams of whole grains, plus antioxidants vitamin E and zinc, Kellogg's FiberPlus Chocolate Chip Bars  fuel your day nutritiously.  Fill Up on Fiber The studies are clear--fiber can help promote weight loss and healthier eating patterns, while increasing overall health: Fiber takes longer to chew and slows down the rate at which we eat--giving our bodies a chance to let us know when we are full. With fewer calories and greater bulk, high-fiber foods help us feel fuller for longer. Fiber helps keep the digestive tract clean and healthy decreasing risk of intestinal disease. Fiber-rich diets can help lower 'bad' cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and help control blood sugar levels.    Snacks Matter Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children and adults with needed energy to keep brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped FiberPlus Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Special K Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go.

Keep going strong with a delicious way to round out your exercise routine.  Frequently Asked Questions  Who should use PowerBar ProteinPlus protein bars? Dedicated athletes that need a great tasting source of protein during post-workout recovery. PowerBar ProteinPlus protein bars are a good choice for athletes who want a convenient source of high-quality protein to help round out their exercise routine. They were developed by the Sports Nutrition experts at PowerBar, and they can help optimize your recovery period after training and competition.  How should I use PowerBar ProteinPlus protein bars? Consume a PowerBar ProteinPlus protein bar after an intense workout. High quality protein should be consumed regularly throughout the day as part of an athlete’s daily protein intake, especially soon after exercise. This can help support long-term maintenance, growth, and repair of lean muscle tissue.  How much protein do I need after exercise? Although protein requirements may vary between individual athletes due to differences in body size or activity level, in general, look to consume between 15–25 grams of protein within an hour after high-intensity exercise to maximize the muscle rebuilding process.  Why is it important to consume carbohydrates in addition to protein? Carbohydrates stored in muscles is called glycogen. Glycogen gets used up during exercise. Consuming carbohydrate within 30 minutes after exercise at two hour intervals for up to six hours is recommended for rebuilding muscle glycogen stores and supports recovery prior to any training session or competition to occur within the next 24 hours.  What are the protein sources in PowerBar ProteinPlus 20g protein bars? The PowerBar TriSource protein blend is a combination of three protein sources: soy protein isolate, calcium caseinate, and whey protein isolate.  What other foods can help provide the level of high quality protein equivalent to one PowerBar ProteinPlus 20g protein bar? The following foods contain approximately the same amount of protein as one PowerBar ProteinPlus protein bar: Milk: Two cups of 2% milk Tuna: One serving (3 oz) Ground Beef: One serving (2.5 oz)  What are the nutritional advantages of PowerBar ProteinPlus 20g protein bars? PowerBar ProteinPlus 20g protein bars deliver high quality protein from our PowerBar TriSource protein blend in each 210 calorie bar. High quality protein such as whey, casein, and soy are effective in supporting the maintenance, repair, and synthesis of lean muscle tissue in response to training. Some athletes generally require 0.6 to 0.9 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. This is 90 to 135 grams each day for a 150lb individual.  I have food allergies.

Be sure, you will not have to lower your expectations even if you are eating a gluten-free, wheat-free snack bar. You do not have to settle for ordinary or tasteless gluten-free bars when Nature’s Path offers so much more--a pinch of this, a dash of that, but never anything artificial. This product contains no artificial additives, preservatives, or colors. Moreover, the USDA organic certification on this product means that the ingredients are grown without synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and nasty chemicals.  It is a sacrifice-free way of enjoying a healthy delicious snack. Whole Grain Goodness for Everyone The specialty of Nature’s Path is, and has always been, everything “whole grain”. If you decide to go “gluten free” then there is no healthier option than organic gluten free--products that are not only gluten free but also free of other things that can compromise health. Add to that, Non-GMO Project verified for an extra assurance when it comes to food safety. Nature’s Path uses gluten-free grains such as buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum, amaranth, brown rice, flax, teff, and whole grain corn . Amaranth: Long considered a native crop in Peru, amaranth was a major food crop of the ancient Aztecs and played a part in their religious practices as well. Amaranth is gluten free, high in protein, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It is the only grain that also contains vitamin C. Brown Rice: Naturally gluten free, whole-grain rice is usually brown but can also be black, purple, or even red. It is one of the most easily digested grains and though it is lower in fiber, it is still rich in many other nutrients. Buckwheat: It is not technically a grain at all and not any kind of wheat, but rather, a cousin of rhubarb! It is the only grain to have high levels of an antioxidant called rutin and of course, it is gluten free too. Certified gluten free and wheat free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization, an independent service that supervises gluten-free food production according to a consistent, defined, science-based standard that is confirmed by field inspections. Nature’s Path was the first USDA Certified producer of organic breakfast cereal in North America and we're the larges manufacturer of organic cereals to this day. Many of our gluten-free products are Non-GMO Project verified. GMO crops are found in so many of the foods implicated in health and digestive issues and have yet to be proven safe. We keep them out of our foods because we don’t believe in using people as guinea pigs in a lab experiment. Quality Assurance International is a third party certification organization that regularly inspects to ensure stringent organic food standards are met. All Nature’s Path foods are Kosher.  Whole Grain Corn: While it’s true that corn may be familiar, don’t overlook it when it comes to antioxidants. Corn has the highest levels of antioxidants of any grain or vegetable! Quinoa: It is another “grain” that is not quite a grain. Quinoa is actually a relative of Swiss chard and beets. This gluten free grain was a favorite of the Incas. It comes from South America and is a small, light colored grain that looks a bit like sesame seeds. It is a complete protein, delivering all the essential amino acids our bodies need. Sorghum: This hearty gluten free grain from Africa thrives where other grains would wither and die. It can be eaten like popcorn, cooked into porridge, or made into flour. It is very popular with people who have gluten issues. Teff: This is a tiny grain that comes from Africa--it is 1/150th the size of a wheat kernel. The fact that “teff” comes from the word “teffa” meaning “lost” starts to make sense. Teff has a sweet, molasses-like taste and can be used for baked goods, porridge, or ""teff polenta"". It is high in iron and calcium. About Nature’s Path For over 25 years, Nature’s Path has been mastering the art of whole grain baking with cereals, snacks, and waffles that are loaded with whole grain nutrition and wholesome goodness. They bake cereals with basic gluten containing grains used in typical manufacturing such as barley, rye, and oats. Out of the 128 innovative products that Nature’s Path makes twenty percent are certified gluten free--and many of these products are also whole grain. Organic is Healthier Organic makes much less impact on the Earth as no synthetic pesticides fertilizers or antibiotics are used and no chemicals are added to the food afterwards. It means less pollution in your world and in your bowl. Organic goes further towards giving you what nature intended--clean, pure, and real food. Nature’s Path has made America’s favorite gluten-free cereals for longer than anyone else has. Nobody offers a wider range of gluten free breakfast options--they know what makes a great tasting breakfast. You can make Nature’s Path your daily breakfast partner today!

It is a 100% vegetable food, containing 92% dried extracted juices of organically grown cereal grasses: barley, oats, rye and wheat (no chemical fertilizers or insecticides are used); and 8% papain, beets and sea kelp. The grasses are cut at the young, rapidly growing stage, when the maximum nutrition is in the blade. The juice is extracted from the grass, chilled, and dried to a powder by a low-heat, vacuum dry process. GreenLife is made without the use of fillers, binders, or synthetic drying agents, such as maltodextrin (sugar). Every known precaution is taken to preserve the integrity and freshness of the vitamins, minerals, and enzymes naturally present in the dried juice. GreenLife is bottled in inert amber glass bottles to block light and prevent nutrient reactivity with plastic, and sealed with nitrogen to prevent oxidation. We use cereal grass - not the grain - so there is no gluten, making it is safe for individuals with wheat allergies. GreenLife is a concentrated product, retaining its natural balance as a complete all-food supplement. It is nontoxic in any consumable amount, and helps balance nutritional deficiencies resulting from consumption of devitalized and processed foods.*    GreenLife is available in tablets (#10) and in powder form (#11).

A Healthy Way to Begin the Day Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that a nutritious breakfast at the beginning of the day can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars help busy families on the go satisfy the nutritional requirements of breakfast in a quick and easy format that can be eaten at the table--or--as life demands, on the road.  Snacks Matter Start Out on the Right Foot: Studies have shown that when you make the right snack choices at the beginning of the day, you are more likely to make good snack decisions the rest of the day. Eating a Nutri-Grain Bar as a mid-morning snack provides four-times more whole grains than traditional morning snacks. Take Control of Your Portions: Regular snacking helps prevent over-eating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day. In fact, up to 25 percent of the average American's calories come from snacking between meals. In order to eat snacks and treats in a healthful way, it is essential to pay attention to portion size. Individually wrapped Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a nutritious snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth in one 120-calorie serving. Easy to pop into a lunchbox, a backpack or purse, Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars provide a great option for nutritious eating on the go. A Snack Everyone Can Agree On: Arguing with kids over the snacks they take to school is second only to arguing over bedtimes. Parents push for nutritious snacks while kids want something sweet. Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars offer the nutrition parents require with the taste that children will love--thanks to the soft, golden crust and sweet, fruit filling.       Whole Grain Goodness More people are becoming aware of the benefits of eating whole grains. Still, most people don't get enough whole grains and up to 80 percent of us are not consuming levels of whole grains recommended by the FDA. Each Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar contains half of a serving (eight grams) of the recommended three servings or more of whole grains people need each day--in a low-calorie and low fat package. Whole grains never tasted this good! Eaten on the run, at the table, as a snack, breakfast, or treat--Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars are a fast and versatile way to ensure that you and your family get the daily nutrition you need.
